0,1965,January,30,State Funeral of Winston Churchill at St Paul's Cathedral in London. Then world's largest ever state funeral.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_state_funeral_of_Winston_Churchill,"Sir Winston Churchill died on 24 January 1965, aged 90. His was the first state funeral for a non-royal family member since Lord Carson in 1935, and as of 2020 it remains the most recent state funeral in the United Kingdom. The official funeral lasted for four days. Planning for the funeral, known as Operation Hope Not, began 12 years before Churchill's death. It was initiated after Churchill's stroke in 1953 while in his second term as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. After several revisions due to Churchill's continued survival, the plan was issued on 26 January 1965, two days after his death. 
By decree of Queen Elizabeth II, his body lay in state at Westminster Hall for three days from 26 January. On 30 January, the order of funeral was held at St Paul's Cathedral. From there the body was transported by water along the River Thames to Waterloo station, accompanied by military salutations. In the afternoon he was buried at St Martin's Churchyard at Bladon, the resting place of his ancestors and his brother. Attended by representatives from 120 countries, 6,000 people, and unusually by the Queen, more than 1,000 police and security personnel, involving nine military bands, 18 military battalions, 16 Royal Air Force English Electric Lightning fighter jets, a special boat MV Havengore and a train hauled by Winston Churchill, homage paid by 321,360 people, and witnessed by over 350 million people, it was the largest state funeral in history.

2,1965,March,22,US confirms its troops used chemical warfare against the Vietcong,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Army_of_Vietnam,"The People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN; Vietnamese: Quân đội Nhân dân Việt Nam), also known as the Vietnamese People's Army (VPA), is the military force of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The PAVN is a part of the Vietnam People's Armed Forces and includes: Ground Force (including Strategic Rear Forces), Navy, Air Force, Border Defence Force, and Coast Guard. However, Vietnam does not have a separate Ground Force or Army branch. All ground troops, army corps, military districts and specialised arms belong to the Ministry of Defence, directly under the command of the Central Military Commission, the Minister of Defence, and the General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army. The military flag of the PAVN is the flag of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, with the words Quyết thắng (Determination to win) added in yellow at the top left.
During the French Indochina War (1946–1954), the PAVN was often referred to as the Việt Minh. In the context of the Vietnam War (1955–1975), the army was referred to as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). This allowed writers, the U.S. military, and the general public, to distinguish northern communists from the southern communists, called Viet Cong or National Liberation Front. However, both groups ultimately worked under the same command structure. The Viet Cong was considered a branch of the VPA by the North Vietnamese. In 2010 the PAVN undertook the role of leading the 1,000th Anniversary Parade in Hanoi by performing their biggest parade in history.","{1026, 2568, 521, 524, 528, 4113, 1562, 28, 2589, 2590, 2078, 1058, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 1584, 2104, 1081, 66, 3139, 2628, 1616, 4688, 1622, 2649, 3163, 4192, 2152, 619, 2155, 3692, 1649, 629, 2169, 3195, 640, 2176, 2703, 144, 3727, 4768, 2213, 174, 4785, 1204, 3777, 1228, 2764, 4307, 3285, 3804, 3805, 4829, 3808, 3303, 4330, 1783, 1275, 1292, 1808, 3869, 4895, 3874, 294, 4905, 4916, 311, 2875, 3903, 1857, 4941, 4942, 1370, 3427, 1386, 4472, 890, 3451, 4993, 4994, 2955, 3979, 1432, 2475, 4020, 4024, 5059, 452, 4549, 2507, 2508, 1997, 5067, 5079, 3034, 1502, 3040, 4074, 492, 5107, 2040, 1017, 3578, 4605}",105,"['US', 'Vietcong', ""The People's Army"", 'Vietnam', 'PAVN', 'Vietnamese', 'Nhân', 'Việt Nam', ""the Vietnamese People's Army"", 'VPA', 'the Socialist Republic of Vietnam', 'PAVN', ""the Vietnam People's Armed Forces"", 'Ground Force', 'Strategic Rear Forces', 'Navy', 'Air Force', 'Border Defence Force', 'Coast Guard', 'Vietnam', 'Ground Force', 'Army', 'army corps', 'the Ministry of Defence', 'the Central Military Commission', 'the General Staff of', ""the Vietnam People's Army"", 'PAVN', 'the Socialist Republic of Vietnam', 'Quyết', 'the French Indochina War', 'PAVN', 'the Việt Minh', 'the Vietnam War', 'the North Vietnamese Army', 'NVA', 'U.S.', 'Viet Cong', 'National Liberation Front', 'The Viet Cong', 'VPA', 'the North Vietnamese', '2010', 'PAVN', 'Hanoi']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE']"
3,1965,May,5,First large-scale US Army ground units arrive in South Vietnam,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_Australia_during_the_Vietnam_War,"Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War began with a small commitment of 30 military advisors in 1962, and increased over the following decade to a peak of 7,672 Australian personnel following the Menzies Government's April 1965 decision to upgrade its military commitment to South Vietnam's security. By the time the last Australian personnel were withdrawn in 1972, the Vietnam War had become Australia's longest war, and was only recently surpassed by Australia's long term commitment of combat forces to the War in Afghanistan. It remains Australia's largest force contribution to a foreign conflict since the Second World War and was also the most controversial in Australian society since the conscription controversy during the First World War. Although initially enjoying broad support due to concerns about the spread of communism in Southeast Asia, a vocal anti-war movement developed in response to Australia's programme of conscription.
The withdrawal of Australia's forces from South Vietnam began in November 1970, under the Gorton Government, when 8 RAR completed its tour of duty and was not replaced. A phased withdrawal followed, and by 11 January 1973 Australian involvement in hostilities in Vietnam had ceased. Nevertheless, Australian troops from the Australian Embassy Platoon remained deployed in the country until 1 July 1973, and Australian forces were deployed briefly in April 1975, during the Fall of Saigon, to evacuate personnel from the Australian embassy. Approximately 60,000 Australians served in the war; 521 were killed and more than 3,000 were wounded.

4,1965,June,7,"The Supreme Court of the United States decides on Griswold v. Connecticut, effectively legalizing the use of contraception by married couples",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade,"Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protects a pregnant woman's liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction. It struck down many U.S. state and federal abortion laws, and prompted an ongoing national debate in the United States about whether and to what extent abortion should be legal, who should decide the legality of abortion, what methods the Supreme Court should use in constitutional adjudication, and what the role  of religious and moral views in the political sphere should be. Roe v. Wade reshaped U.S. politics, dividing much of the United States into abortion rights and anti-abortion movements, while activating grassroots movements on both sides.
The decision involved the case of a woman named Norma McCorvey—known in her lawsuit under the pseudonym ""Jane Roe""—who in 1969 became pregnant with her third child and wanted an abortion. However, McCorvey lived in Texas, where abortion was illegal except when necessary to save the mother's life. She was referred to lawyers Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, who filed a lawsuit on her behalf in U.S. federal court against her local district attorney, Henry Wade, alleging that Texas's abortion laws were unconstitutional. A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas heard the case and ruled in her favor. Texas then appealed this ruling directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.
In January 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides a ""right to privacy"" that protects a pregnant woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. However, it held that this right is not absolute, and must be balanced against the government's interests in protecting women's health and protecting prenatal life. The Court resolved this balancing test by tying state regulation of abortion to the three trimesters of pregnancy: during the first trimester, governments could not prohibit abortions at all; during the second trimester, governments could require reasonable health regulations; during the third trimester, abortions could be prohibited entirely so long as the laws contained exceptions for cases when they were necessary to save the life or health of the mother. The Court classified the right to choose to have an abortion as ""fundamental"", which required courts to evaluate challenged abortion laws under the ""strict scrutiny"" standard, the highest level of judicial review in the United States.Roe was criticized by some in the legal community, and some have called the decision a form of judicial activism. In a prominent Yale Law Journal article published soon after the decision was issued, the legal scholar John Hart Ely criticized Roe as a decision that ""is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be."" In 1992, the Supreme Court revisited and modified its legal rulings in Roe in the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In Casey, the Court reaffirmed Roe's holding that a woman's right to choose to have an abortion is constitutionally protected, but abandoned Roe's trimester framework in favor of a standard based on fetal viability, and overruled Roe's requirement that government regulations on abortion be subjected to the strict scrutiny standard.","{640, 4993, 3842, 4994, 4101, 7, 2955, 2703, 1168, 3727, 3989, 4895, 4768, 2169, 290, 2210, 2982, 4134, 1576, 2601, 4905, 2171, 815, 1201, 2740, 309, 4024, 2875, 4539, 452, 4549, 1222, 967, 2122, 971, 2507, 2509, 4682, 4815, 3322, 595, 2388, 3795, 1622, 4307, 5077, 3805, 3180, 4589, 1649, 889, 4474, 3451, 4605}",54,"['The Supreme Court', 'the United States', 'Griswold', 'Connecticut', 'Roe v.

5,1965,August,6,US President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Voting Rights Act prohibiting voting discrimination against minorities,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965,"The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a landmark piece of federal legislation in the United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. It was signed into law by United States President Lyndon B. Johnson during the height of the civil rights movement on August 6, 1965, and Congress later amended the Act five times to expand its protections. Designed to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Act secured the right to vote for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Act is considered to be the most effective piece of federal civil rights legislation ever enacted in the country.The Act contains numerous provisions that regulate elections. The Act's ""general provisions"" provide nationwide protections for voting rights. Section 2 is a general provision that prohibits every state and local government from imposing any voting law that results in discrimination against racial or language minorities. Other general provisions specifically outlaw literacy tests and similar devices that were historically used to disenfranchise racial minorities.
The Act also contains ""special provisions"" that apply to only certain jurisdictions. A core special provision is the Section 5 preclearance requirement, which prohibits certain jurisdictions from implementing any change affecting voting without receiving preapproval from the U.S. Attorney General or the U.S. District Court for D.C. that the change does not discriminate against protected minorities. Another special provision requires jurisdictions containing significant language minority populations to provide bilingual ballots and other election materials.
Section 5 and most other special provisions apply to jurisdictions encompassed by the ""coverage formula"" prescribed in Section 4(b). The coverage formula was originally designed to encompass jurisdictions that engaged in egregious voting discrimination in 1965, and Congress updated the formula in 1970 and 1975. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the coverage formula as unconstitutional, reasoning that it was no longer responsive to current conditions. The Court did not strike down Section 5, but without a coverage formula, Section 5 is unenforceable.","{1378, 4741}",2,"['US', 'Lyndon B.

6,1965,August,9,Singapore separates from the Federation of Malaysia and gains its independence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_in_Malaysia,"Singapore was one of the 14 states of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965. Malaysia was formed on 16 September 1963 by the merger of the Federation of Malaya with the former British colonies of North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore. This marked the end of a 144-year British rule in Singapore which began with the founding of modern Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819.
The union was unstable due to distrust and ideological differences between leaders of Singapore and of the federal government of Malaysia. They often disagreed about finance, politics and racial policies. Singapore continued to face significant trade restrictions despite promises of a common market in return for a large proportion of her tax revenues, and retaliated by withholding loans to Sabah and Sarawak. In the political arena, the Malay-based United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and Singapore-based People's Action Party (PAP), entered each other's political arenas, despite previous agreements not to do so. These resulted in major race riots in Singapore in 1964, which were attributed (at least in part) to instigation by UMNO and its Malay-language newspaper Utusan Melayu for affirmative action for Malays in Singapore.These culminated in the decision by Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman to expel Singapore from the Federation, and on 9 August 1965, Singapore became the first and only modern country to date to gain independence unwillingly. While their paths have diverged subsequently, both countries continue to co-operate in many areas and organisations such as ASEAN and the Five Power Defence Arrangements.","{128, 4993, 3842, 640, 901, 7, 3989, 4891, 4768, 2210, 4134, 2171, 2096, 561, 4539, 4549, 967, 2122, 971, 2507, 4682, 4815, 595, 467, 3795, 4307, 5077, 3834, 3803, 2398, 1502, 2529, 3434, 4971, 3180, 4589, 3702, 889, 4474, 3451, 5117}",41,"['Singapore', 'the Federation of Malaysia', 'Singapore', 'Malaysia', '1963 to', '1965', 'Malaysia', '16 September 1963', 'the Federation of Malaya', 'British', 'North Borneo', 'Sarawak', 'Singapore', 'British', 'Singapore', 'Singapore', 'Stamford Raffles', '1819', 'Singapore', 'Malaysia', 'Singapore', 'Sabah', 'Sarawak', 'Malay', 'United Malays National Organisation', 'Singapore', ""People's Action Party"", 'Singapore', '1964', 'UMNO', 'Malay', 'Utusan Melayu', 'Malays', 'Singapore', 'Malaysian', 'Tunku Abdul Rahman', 'Singapore', '9 August 1965', 'Singapore', 'ASEAN', 'the Five Power Defence Arrangements']","['GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'LANGUAGE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG']"
7,1965,September,22,"India and Pakistan cease-fire goes into effect, ending the Indo-Pakistani War",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965,"The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a culmination of skirmishes that took place between April 1965 and September 1965 between Pakistan and India. The conflict began following Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against Indian rule. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan. The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II. Hostilities between the two countries ended after a United Nations-mandated ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. Much of the war was fought by the countries' land forces in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan. This war saw the largest amassing of troops in Kashmir since the Partition of India in 1947, a number that was overshadowed only during the 2001–2002 military standoff between India and Pakistan. Most of the battles were fought by opposing infantry and armoured units, with substantial backing from air forces, and naval operations. Many details of this war, like those of other Indo-Pakistani Wars, remain unclear.India had the upper hand over Pakistan when the ceasefire was declared.  Although the two countries fought to a standoff, the conflict is seen as a strategic and political defeat for Pakistan, as it had neither succeeded in fomenting insurrection in Kashmir nor had it been able to gain meaningful support at an international level.Internationally, the war was viewed in the context of the greater Cold War, and resulted in a significant geopolitical shift in the subcontinent. Before the war, the United States and the United Kingdom had been major material allies of both India and Pakistan, as their primary suppliers of military hardware and foreign developmental aid. During and after the conflict, both India and Pakistan felt betrayed by the perceived lack of support by the western powers for their respective positions; those feelings of betrayal were increased with the imposition of an American and British embargo on military aid to the opposing sides. As a consequence, India and Pakistan openly developed closer relationships with the Soviet Union and China, respectively. The perceived negative stance of the western powers during the conflict, and during the 1971 war, has continued to affect relations between the West and the subcontinent.

8,1965,December,7,Pope Paul VI & Orthodox Patriarch Athenagoras I simultaneously lift mutual excommunications that led to split of 2 churches in 1054,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christianity,"The history of Christianity concerns the Christian religion, Christendom, and the Church with its various denominations, from the 1st century to the present.
Christianity originated with the ministry of Jesus in the 1st century Roman province of Judea. According to the Gospels, Jesus was a Jewish teacher and healer who proclaimed the imminent Kingdom of God, and was crucified c.30‑33 AD. His followers believed that he was then raised from the dead and exalted by God, and would return soon at the inception of God's Kingdom.
The earliest followers of Jesus were apocalyptic Jewish Christians. Due to the inclusion of gentiles, the developing early Christian Church gradually grew apart from Judaism and Jewish Christianity during the first two centuries of the Christian Era.
In 313, Emperor Constantine I issued the Edict of Milan legalizing Christian worship. In 380, with the Edict of Thessalonica put forth under Theodosius I, the Roman Empire officially adopted Trinitarian Christianity as its state religion, and Christianity established itself as a predominantly gentile religion in the state church of the Roman Empire.
Christological debates about the human and divine nature of Jesus consumed the Christian Church for a couple of centuries, and seven eucumenical councils were called to resolve these debates. Arianism was condemned at the First Council of Nicea (325), which supported the Trinitarian doctrine as expounded in the Nicene Creed.
In the early Middle Ages, missionary activities spread Christianity towards the west among German peoples. During the High Middle Ages, eastern and western Christianity grew apart, leading to the East-West Schism of 1054. Growing criticism of the Roman Catholic ecclesiological structure and its behaviour, led to the Protestant movement of the 16th century and the split of western Christianity.
Since the Renaissance era, with western colonialism, Christianity has expanded throughout the world. Today there are more than two billion Christians worldwide, and Christianity has become the world's largest religion. Within the last century, as the influence of Christianity has waned in the West, it has also rapidly grown in the East and the Global South in China, South Korea and much of sub-Saharan Africa. There has been recent growth of Christianity in Iran.","{1031, 521, 1038, 1041, 2579, 28, 1058, 1584, 2615, 2104, 4154, 576, 3139, 580, 70, 2119, 3656, 2131, 1109, 1622, 2647, 3676, 4192, 2150, 2152, 3692, 2191, 1178, 2721, 4774, 1192, 1193, 176, 4785, 703, 3777, 1240, 4829, 1251, 3299, 1783, 1272, 3322, 1275, 767, 3842, 1795, 3332, 4868, 4871, 283, 4895, 1824, 1830, 3886, 2874, 3903, 1346, 2372, 843, 2382, 2898, 2901, 1370, 3437, 885, 1397, 890, 4993, 4994, 900, 2955, 1452, 4017, 2487, 3005, 1471, 452, 964, 1997, 1491, 3553, 2026, 4074, 3054, 498, 1015, 1017, 3578, 4605}",90,"['Pope Paul VI & Orthodox', 'Patriarch Athenagoras', '1054', 'Christianity', 'Christian', 'Christendom', 'Church', 'the 1st century', 'Christianity', 'the ministry of Jesus', 'the 1st century', 'Roman province', 'Judea', 'Gospels', 'Jesus', 'Jewish', 'God', 'Jesus', 'Jewish', 'Christians', 'Judaism', 'Jewish', 'the first two centuries', 'the Christian Era', 'Milan', 'Christian', 'the Edict of Thessalonica', 'Theodosius I', 'the Roman Empire', 'Trinitarian Christianity', 'Christianity', 'the Roman Empire', 'Jesus', 'the Christian Church', 'a couple of centuries', 'the First Council of Nicea', 'Trinitarian', 'the Nicene Creed', 'the early Middle Ages', 'Christianity', 'German', 'the High Middle Ages', 'eastern', 'Christianity', 'the East-West Schism', '1054', 'Roman Catholic', 'Protestant', 'the 16th century', 'Christianity', 'Renaissance', 'Christianity', 'Today', 'Christians', 'Christianity', 'the last century', 'Christianity', 'East', 'the Global South', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Saharan Africa', 'Christianity', 'Iran']","['ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE']"
9,1965,December,8,Pope Paul VI signs 2nd Vatican council,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II,"Pope John Paul II (Latin: Ioannes Paulus II; Italian: Giovanni Paolo II; Polish: Jan Paweł II; born Karol Józef Wojtyła [ˈkarɔl ˈjuzɛv vɔjˈtɨwa]; 18 May 1920 – 2 April 2005) was head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State from 1978 to 2005. 
He was elected pope by the second papal conclave of 1978, which was called after Pope John Paul I, who had been elected in August to succeed Pope Paul VI, died after 33 days. Cardinal Wojtyła was elected on the third day of the conclave and adopted the name of his predecessor in tribute to him. John Paul II is recognised as helping to end Communist rule in his native Poland and eventually all of Europe. John Paul II significantly improved the Catholic Church's relations with Judaism, Islam, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. He upheld the Church's teachings on such matters as the right to life, artificial contraception, the ordination of women, and a celibate clergy, and although he supported the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, he was seen as generally conservative in their interpretation.He was one of the most travelled world leaders in history, visiting 129 countries during his pontificate. As part of his special emphasis on the universal call to holiness, he beatified 1,340 and canonised 483 people, more than the combined tally of his predecessors during the preceding five centuries. By the time of his death, he had named most of the College of Cardinals, consecrated or co-consecrated a large number of the world's bishops, and ordained many priests.John Paul II was the second longest-serving pope in modern history after Pope Pius IX. Born in Poland, John Paul II was the first non-Italian pope since the 16th-century Pope Adrian VI. John Paul II's cause for canonisation commenced one month after his death with the traditional five-year waiting period waived. On 19 December 2009, John Paul II was proclaimed venerable by his successor, Benedict XVI, and was beatified on 1 May 2011 (Divine Mercy Sunday) after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints attributed one miracle to his intercession, the healing of a French nun from Parkinson's disease. A second miracle was approved on 2 July 2013, and confirmed by Pope Francis two days later. John Paul II was canonised on 27 April 2014 (again Divine Mercy Sunday), together with Pope John XXIII. On 11 September 2014, Pope Francis added these two optional memorials to the worldwide General Roman Calendar of saints. It is traditional to celebrate saints' feast days on the anniversary of their deaths, but that of John Paul II (22 October) is celebrated on the anniversary of his papal inauguration. Posthumously, he has been referred to by some Catholics as ""St. John Paul the Great"", although the title has no official recognition.","{640, 4993, 3842, 2051, 900, 4994, 7, 903, 1162, 2955, 1036, 3979, 2703, 144, 1168, 1275, 4756, 3989, 1177, 28, 4895, 4768, 1058, 3874, 4775, 1192, 1576, 1323, 2475, 174, 1583, 1584, 4526, 2483, 4020, 4661, 2104, 4024, 4536, 3903, 576, 4671, 452, 1732, 3524, 3272, 843, 208, 2004, 2388, 1622, 2647, 2901, 2529, 3427, 2278, 3046, 234, 3693, 494, 4589, 1649, 2040, 2169, 3322, 3451, 4605, 4986}",68,"['Pope Paul VI', 'Vatican', 'John Paul II', 'Latin', 'Italian', 'Giovanni Paolo II', 'Polish', 'Jan Paweł II', 'Karol Józef Wojtyła', 'May 1920', '2 April 2005', 'the Catholic Church', 'the Vatican City State', '1978 to 2005', '1978', 'John Paul', 'August', 'Paul VI', '33 days', 'Cardinal Wojtyła', 'the third day', 'John Paul II', 'Communist', 'Poland', 'Europe', 'John Paul II', ""the Catholic Church's"", 'Islam', 'the Eastern Orthodox Church', 'Church', 'the Second Vatican Council', 'the preceding five centuries', 'the College of Cardinals', 'John Paul II', 'Pope Pius IX', 'Poland', 'John Paul II', 'non-Italian', 'the 16th-century', ""John Paul II's"", 'one month', 'five-year', '19 December 2009', 'John Paul II', 'Benedict XVI', '1 May 2011', 'Sunday', 'Saints', 'French', '2 July 2013', 'Pope Francis', 'two days later', 'John Paul II', '27 April 2014', 'Divine Mercy', 'Sunday', 'John XXIII', '11 September 2014', 'Pope Francis', 'Roman Calendar', 'John Paul II', '22 October', 'Catholics']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP']"

The film is an adaptation of the 1959 stage musical of the same name, composed by Richard Rodgers with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. The film's screenplay was written by Ernest Lehman, adapted from the stage musical's book by Lindsay and Crouse. Based on the memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria von Trapp, the film is about a young Austrian postulant in Salzburg, Austria, in 1938 who is sent to the villa of a retired naval officer and widower to be governess to his seven children. After bringing love and music into the lives of the family, she marries the officer and, together with the children, finds a way to survive the loss of their homeland to the Nazis.
The film was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited roadshow theatrical release. Although critical response to the film was mixed, the film was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office movie after four weeks, and the highest-grossing film of 1965. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all-time—surpassing Gone with the Wind—and held that distinction for five years. The film was just as popular throughout the world, breaking previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries. Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years, and two successful re-releases, the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286,000,000.
The Sound of Music received five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. The film also received two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture and Best Actress, the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. In 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) listed The Sound of Music as the fifty-fifth greatest American movie of all time, and the fourth greatest movie musical. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".","{1025, 2051, 515, 4611, 7, 2568, 4134, 1576, 4671, 1095, 2122, 4682, 595, 1622, 2141, 608, 3180, 1646, 1136, 1649, 2169, 2682, 2171, 127, 640, 4736, 1678, 2703, 3727, 1177, 4768, 2721, 2210, 174, 1710, 1739, 4815, 3795, 4307, 3799, 3803, 3812, 748, 3322, 3842, 1795, 3348, 3862, 4895, 3874, 4905, 4400, 1847, 4920, 826, 2875, 3908, 4430, 2388, 1888, 1890, 873, 4971, 1388, 3951, 889, 4474, 3451, 892, 4990, 4993, 4994, 387, 3459, 2955, 3979, 1938, 1432, 4007, 5033, 2475, 2483, 4020, 4024, 1979, 4539, 3520, 1985, 452, 3524, 1990, 967, 4549, 971, 2507, 1997, 5074, 467, 4051, 5077, 2525, 1502, 2018, 997, 4589, 4605}",106,"['The Sound of Music', 'Julie Andrews', 'Christopher Plummer', 'Academy Awards Best Picture 1966', '1965', 'American', 'Robert Wise', 'Julie Andrews', 'Christopher Plummer', 'Richard Haydn', 'Eleanor Parker', '1959', 'Richard Rodgers', 'Oscar Hammerstein II', 'Ernest Lehman', 'Lindsay', 'Crouse', 'The Story of the Trapp Family Singers', 'Maria von Trapp', 'Austrian', 'Salzburg', 'Austria', '1938', 'Nazis', 'March 2, 1965', 'the United States', 'four weeks', '1965', 'November 1966', 'The Sound of Music', 'five years', 'four and a half years', 'The Sound of Music', 'Academy Awards', 'Best Picture and Best Director', 'America', 'the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical', '1998', 'the American Film Institute', 'AFI', 'The Sound of Music', 'American', '2001', 'the United States', 'Congress', 'the National Film Registry']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG']"

His music was largely ignored during his early life, and many of his works went unperformed for many years. Later in life, the quality of his music was publicly recognized, and he came to be regarded as an ""American original"". He was also among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatory elements, and quarter tones. His experimentation foreshadowed many musical innovations that were later more widely adopted during the 20th century. Hence, he is often regarded as the leading American composer of art music of the 20th century.Sources of Ives' tonal imagery included hymn tunes and traditional songs; he also incorporated melodies of the town band at holiday parade, the fiddlers at Saturday night dances, patriotic songs, sentimental parlor ballads, and the melodies of Stephen Foster.","{2051, 1539, 4611, 7, 2568, 4642, 4134, 1576, 1583, 4671, 589, 3151, 4688, 595, 2647, 2141, 1633, 3686, 1640, 3693, 1646, 1136, 2169, 2682, 127, 4224, 1153, 1668, 1162, 1678, 1167, 2702, 1177, 4775, 1192, 694, 1739, 4307, 3803, 1251, 3812, 3813, 2793, 2794, 748, 1780, 3322, 1275, 3842, 1795, 1288, 1802, 3862, 4910, 1847, 4920, 826, 4426, 1867, 2379, 2891, 4430, 2388, 2901, 3927, 1888, 1890, 3427, 873, 1388, 2415, 889, 3451, 892, 4990, 387, 3459, 2955, 3979, 2964, 1432, 418, 4007, 5033, 2483, 948, 4024, 1985, 3524, 1990, 967, 2507, 1997, 4051, 5088, 1508, 997, 2026, 4589, 1526}",100,"[""Charles Ives'"", 'Carnegie Hall', 'New York', '11 years', 'Charles Edward Ives', 'October 20, 1874', 'May 19, 1954', 'American', 'American', 'many years', 'American', 'the 20th century', 'American', 'the 20th century', 'Saturday', 'Stephen Foster']","['PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON']"
14,1965,June,15,"Bob Dylan records single ""Like a Rolling Stone"" (#1 in Rolling Stone magazine's ""500 Greatest Songs of All Time"")",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Rolling_Stone,"""Like a Rolling Stone"" is a 1965 song by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. ""Like a Rolling Stone"" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album Highway 61 Revisited.
During a difficult two-day preproduction, Dylan struggled to find the essence of the song, which was demoed without success in 34 time. A breakthrough was made when it was tried in a rock music format, and rookie session musician Al Kooper improvised the organ riff for which the track is known. However, Columbia Records was unhappy with both the song's length at over six minutes and its heavy electric sound, and was hesitant to release it. It was only when a month later a copy was leaked to a new popular music club and heard by influential DJs that the song was put out as a single. Although radio stations were reluctant to play such a long track, ""Like a Rolling Stone"" reached No. 2 in the US Billboard charts (No. 1 in Cashbox) and became a worldwide hit.
Critics have described the track as revolutionary in its combination of different musical elements, the youthful, cynical sound of Dylan's voice, and the directness of the question ""How does it feel?"" ""Like a Rolling Stone"" completed the transformation of Dylan's image from folk singer to rock star, and is considered one of the most influential compositions in postwar popular music. According to review aggregator Acclaimed Music, ""Like a Rolling Stone"" is the statistically most acclaimed song of all time. Rolling Stone magazine listed the song at No. 1 in their ""500 Greatest Songs of All Time"" list. The song has been covered by numerous artists, from the Jimi Hendrix Experience and the Rolling Stones to the Wailers and Green Day. At an auction in 2014, Dylan's handwritten lyrics to the song fetched $2 million, a world record for a popular music manuscript.","{4101, 2078, 1573, 4134, 4647, 1583, 2096, 2122, 4682, 4688, 3154, 595, 3666, 619, 2155, 3180, 3693, 1136, 1653, 2169, 2170, 2682, 640, 1153, 131, 4741, 3207, 4750, 4758, 4768, 2210, 677, 173, 690, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 4313, 3805, 744, 2794, 748, 2798, 4859, 3842, 1795, 1808, 807, 4916, 309, 311, 1847, 4920, 4924, 2388, 4445, 1388, 2415, 889, 4474, 3451, 4990, 4993, 386, 387, 3460, 3970, 2955, 1422, 1938, 3989, 4007, 4014, 2995, 4539, 4549, 1990, 967, 5065, 971, 2507, 5074, 5077, 1502, 3040, 2018, 997, 4589, 5106, 1526}",93,"['Bob Dylan', 'Like a Rolling Stone', ""Rolling Stone magazine's"", 'Greatest Songs of All Time', 'Like a Rolling Stone', '1965', 'American', 'Bob Dylan', 'Dylan', 'June 1965', 'England', 'Dylan', 'a Rolling Stone', 'a few weeks later', 'two-day', 'Dylan', 'Al Kooper', 'Columbia Records', 'a month later', 'Like a Rolling Stone', 'US', 'Cashbox', 'Dylan', 'Like a Rolling Stone', 'Dylan', 'Like a Rolling Stone', 'Rolling Stone', 'Greatest Songs of All Time', 'the Jimi Hendrix Experience', 'the Rolling Stones', 'Wailers', 'Green Day', '2014', 'Dylan']","['PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG']"
15,1965,July,25,"Bob Dylan is booed by sections of the crowd at the Newport Folk Festival for performing with an electric guitar, beginning of folk-rock",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_rock,"Folk rock is a hybrid music genre combining elements of folk music and rock music, which arose in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom in the mid-1960s. In the U.S., folk rock emerged from the folk music revival and the influence that the Beatles and other British Invasion bands had on members of that movement. Performers such as Bob Dylan and the Byrds—several of whose members had earlier played in folk ensembles—attempted to blend the sounds of rock with their pre-existing folk repertoire, adopting the use of electric instrumentation and drums in a way previously discouraged in the U.S. folk community. The term ""folk rock"" was initially used in the U.S. music press in June 1965 to describe the Byrds' music.
The commercial success of the Byrds' cover version of Dylan's ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" and their debut album of the same name, along with Dylan's own recordings with rock instrumentation—on the albums Bringing It All Back Home (1965), Highway 61 Revisited (1965), and Blonde on Blonde (1966)—encouraged other folk acts, such as Simon & Garfunkel, to use electric backing on their records and new groups, such as Buffalo Springfield, to form. Dylan's controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival on 25 July 1965, where he was backed by an electric band, was also a pivotal moment in the development of the genre.
During the late 1960s in Britain and Europe, a distinct, eclectic British folk rock style was created by Pentangle, Fairport Convention and Alan Stivell. Inspired by British psychedelic folk and the North American style of folk rock, British folk rock bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire, leading to other variants, including the overtly English folk rock of the Albion Band and Celtic rock.","{3842, 4611, 1795, 3459, 3970, 7, 2568, 2955, 4235, 5010, 278, 1432, 2169, 2210, 3365, 3621, 1319, 1576, 4775, 3882, 2171, 1711, 4400, 4785, 826, 1979, 2621, 4413, 703, 4671, 580, 3268, 583, 3322, 75, 4558, 4307, 2004, 2388, 4437, 4563, 4445, 4829, 744, 4986, 4330, 4971, 748, 1133, 4589, 3186, 4472, 889, 3578, 3451, 4605, 4990}",57,"['Bob Dylan', 'the Newport Folk Festival', 'the United States', 'Canada', 'the United Kingdom', 'the mid-1960s', 'U.S.', 'Beatles', 'British', 'Bob Dylan', 'Byrds', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'June 1965', 'Byrds', 'Byrds', 'Dylan', 'Tambourine Man', 'Dylan', 'Bringing It All Back Home', '1965', 'Blonde', 'Blonde', 'Simon & Garfunkel', 'Buffalo Springfield', 'Dylan', 'the Newport Folk Festival', '25 July 1965', 'the late 1960s', 'Britain', 'Europe', 'British', 'Pentangle', 'Alan Stivell', 'British', 'North American', 'British', 'British', 'English', 'the Albion Band', 'Celtic']","['PERSON', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'LANGUAGE', 'ORG', 'NORP']"

Mantle played his entire Major League Baseball (MLB) career (1951–1968) with the New York Yankees as a center fielder, right fielder, and first baseman. Mantle was one of the best players and sluggers and is regarded by many as the greatest switch hitter in baseball history. Mantle was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999.
Mantle was one of the greatest offensive threats of any center fielder in baseball history. He has the second highest career OPS+ among center fielders, (behind Mike Trout) and he had the highest stolen base percentage in history at the time of his retirement. In addition, compared to the other four center fielders on the All-Century team, he had the lowest career rate of grounding into double plays, and he had the highest World Series on-base percentage and World Series slugging percentage. He also had an excellent .984 fielding percentage when playing center field. Mantle was noted for his ability to hit for both average and power, especially tape measure home runs, a term that was originated by a play-by-play caller reacting to one of Mantle's 1953 home runs. He hit 536 MLB career home runs, batted .300 or more ten times, and is the career leader (tied with Jim Thome) in walk-off home runs, with thirteen — twelve in the regular season, one in the postseason.
Mantle is 16th all-time in Home runs per at bats. He is 18th in on-base percentage . He was safe three out of four times he attempted to steal a base. He won the MVP Award three times, came in second three times, and came within nine votes of winning five times.
Mantle won the Triple Crown in 1956, when he led the major leagues in batting average (.353), home runs (52), and runs batted in (RBI) (130). He later wrote a  book (My Favorite Summer 1956) about his best year in baseball. He was an All-Star for 16 seasons, playing in 16 of the 20 All-Star Games that were played during his career. He was an American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times and a Gold Glove winner once. Mantle appeared in 12 World Series including seven championships, and he holds World Series records for the most home runs (18), RBIs (40), extra-base hits (26), runs (42), walks (43), and total bases (123).","{260, 3332, 1929, 778, 400, 145, 5010, 3091, 661, 663, 793, 2717, 4516, 1190, 1711, 2480, 2487, 1464, 58, 4287, 3777, 580, 1605, 328, 5070, 3676, 1373, 2525, 2172}",29,"['Mickey Mantle Day', 'Yankee Stadium:', 'Mickey Charles Mantle', 'October 20, 1931', 'August 13, 1995', 'The Commerce Comet', 'The Mick', 'American', 'Mantle', 'Major League Baseball', 'the New York Yankees', 'Mantle', 'Mantle', 'the Baseball Hall of Fame', '1974', 'the Major League Baseball All-Century Team', '1999', 'OPS+', 'Mike Trout', 'All-Century', 'World Series', 'World Series', 'Mantle', 'Mantle', '1953', 'Jim Thome', 'the regular season', 'the MVP Award three times', '1956', 'RBI', '(My Favorite Summer 1956', '16 seasons', 'American League (AL', 'Mantle', 'World Series', 'World Series']","['PERSON', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'EVENT']"

In India's parliamentary system, the Constitution names the President as head of state de jure, but his or her de facto executive powers are vested in the prime minister and their Council of Ministers. Appointed and sworn-in by the President, the prime minister is usually the leader of the party or alliance that has a majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament of India.Since 1947 India has had 14 prime ministers, 15 including Gulzarilal Nanda who twice acted in the role of which 6 having at least one full term, ruling country for about 60 years. The first was Jawaharlal Nehru of the Indian National Congress party, who was sworn in on 15 August 1947, when India gained independence from the British Raj. Serving until his death in May 1964, Nehru remains India's longest-serving prime minister. He was succeeded by fellow Congressman Lal Bahadur Shastri, whose 19-month term also ended in death. Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, succeeded Shastri in 1966 to become the country's first woman prime minister. Eleven years later, she was voted out of power in favour of the Janata Party, whose leader Morarji Desai became the first non-Congress prime minister. After he resigned in 1979, his former deputy Charan Singh briefly held office until Indira Gandhi was voted back six months later. Her second stint as prime minister ended five years later on 31 October 1984, when she was assassinated by her own bodyguards. Her son Rajiv Gandhi was then sworn in as India's youngest premier and the third from his family. Members of Nehru–Gandhi family have been prime minister for a total of 37 years and 303 days.Rajiv's five-year term ended with his former cabinet colleague, V. P. Singh of the Janata Dal, forming the year-long National Front coalition government in 1989. A seven-month interlude under prime minister Chandra Shekhar followed, after which the Congress party returned to power, forming the government under P. V. Narasimha Rao in June 1991. Rao's five-year term was succeeded by four short-lived governments—Atal Bihari Vajpayee from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for 13 days in 1996, a year each under United Front prime ministers H. D. Deve Gowda and I. K. Gujral, and Vajpayee again for 19 months in 1998–99. After Vajpayee was sworn-in for the third time, in 1999, he managed to lead his National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to a full five-year term, the first non-Congress alliance to do so. Vajpayee was succeeded by Manmohan Singh, whose United Progressive Alliance government was in office for 10 years between 2004 and 2014.

Six missions landed men on the Moon, beginning with Apollo 11 in July 1969, during which Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the Moon. Apollo 13 was intended to land, however it was restricted to a flyby due to a malfunction aboard the spacecraft. All nine crewed missions returned safely to the Earth.
While the United States focused on the crewed Apollo program, the Soviet Union conducted uncrewed missions that deployed rovers and returned samples to the Earth. Three rover missions were launched, of which two were successful, and eleven sample return flights were attempted with three successes.
Missions to the Moon have been conducted by the Soviet Union, United States, European Space Agency, Japan, India, People's Republic of China, Luxembourg and Israel. The Moon has also been visited by five spacecraft not dedicated to studying it; four spacecraft have flown past it to gain gravity assistance, and a radio telescope, Explorer 49, was placed into selenocentric orbit in order to use the Moon to block interference from terrestrial radio sources.","{7, 528, 28, 3612, 4642, 4140, 565, 1591, 2104, 1081, 4675, 580, 1095, 3154, 595, 2645, 2137, 603, 608, 609, 3692, 3702, 2171, 128, 4235, 4770, 1703, 1192, 1197, 4785, 703, 704, 1222, 2763, 717, 1746, 4307, 2261, 4829, 3814, 743, 3322, 3842, 3864, 1832, 3882, 3885, 4915, 4413, 2884, 839, 843, 4430, 2388, 854, 4951, 1370, 352, 4971, 370, 375, 889, 4986, 4477, 3970, 900, 2948, 903, 1931, 2955, 4492, 1938, 2964, 2982, 423, 430, 4536, 442, 1979, 4547, 452, 1483, 463, 1999, 4561, 2514, 2004, 3046, 4074, 494, 1017, 3578, 4605}",93,"['1st', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Earth', 'Moon', 'the Soviet Union', 'Moon', '13 September 1959', '1966', 'Between 1968 and 1972', 'Moon', 'the United States', 'Apollo', 'December 1968', 'Apollo', 'May 1969', 'Apollo', 'July 1969', 'Neil Armstrong', 'Moon', 'Earth', 'the United States', 'Apollo', 'the Soviet Union', 'Earth', 'Moon', 'the Soviet Union', 'United States', 'European Space Agency', 'Japan', 'India', ""People's Republic of China"", 'Luxembourg', 'Israel', 'Moon']","['DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON']"
23,1966,March,11,Military coup led by Indonesian General Suharto breaks out,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366,"The Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66 (Indonesian genocide, Indonesian Communist Purge, Indonesian politicide, or the 1965 Tragedy) (Indonesian: Pembunuhan Massal Indonesia & Pembersihan G.30.S/PKI) were large-scale killings and civil unrest that occurred in Indonesia over several months, targeting Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) party members, Communist sympathisers, Gerwani women, ethnic Abangan Javanese, ethnic Chinese and alleged leftists, often at the instigation of the armed forces and government. It began as an anti-communist purge following a controversial attempted coup d'état by the 30 September Movement. The most widely published estimates were that 500,000 to more than one million people were killed, with some more recent estimates going as high as two to three million. The purge was a pivotal event in the transition to the ""New Order"" and the elimination of PKI as a political force, with impacts on the global Cold War. The upheavals led to the fall of President Sukarno and the commencement of Suharto's three-decade authoritarian presidency.
The claims of a coup attempt by Communists released pent-up communal hatreds; these were fanned by the Indonesian Army, which quickly blamed the PKI. Communists were purged from political, social, and military life, and the PKI itself was disbanded and banned. The massacres began in October 1965, in the weeks following the coup attempt, and reached their peak over the remainder of the year before subsiding in the early months of 1966. They started in the capital, Jakarta, and spread to Central and East Java, and later Bali. Thousands of local vigilantes and army units killed actual and alleged PKI members. Killings occurred across the country, with the worst in the PKI strongholds of Central Java, East Java, Bali, and northern Sumatra. It is possible that over one million people were imprisoned at one time or another.
Sukarno's balancing act of ""Nasakom"" (nationalism, religion and communism) had unravelled. His most significant pillar of support, the PKI, was effectively eliminated by the other two pillars—the army and political Islam; and the army was on the way to unchallenged power. In March 1967, Sukarno was stripped of his remaining power by Indonesia's provisional Parliament, and Suharto was named Acting President. In March 1968, Suharto was formally elected president.
The killings are skipped over in most Indonesian history textbooks and have received little introspection by Indonesians, due to their suppression under the Suharto regime. The search for satisfactory explanations for the scale and frenzy of the violence has challenged scholars from all ideological perspectives. The possibility of a return to similar upheavals is cited as a factor in the ""New Order"" administration's political conservatism and tight control of the political system. Vigilance and stigma against a perceived communist threat remained a hallmark of Suharto's doctrine, and it is still in force even today.Despite a consensus at the highest levels of the US and British governments that it would be necessary ""to liquidate Sukarno"", as related in a CIA memorandum from 1962, and the existence of extensive contacts between anti-communist army officers and the US military establishment – training of over 1,200 officers, ""including senior military figures"", and providing weapons and economic assistance – the CIA denied active involvement in the killings. Declassified US documents in 2017 revealed that the US government had detailed knowledge of the mass killings from the beginning, and was supportive of the actions of the Indonesian Army. US complicity in the killings, which included providing extensive lists of PKI officials to Indonesian death squads, has previously been established by historians and journalists. A top-secret CIA report from 1968 stated that the massacres ""rank as one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century, along with the Soviet purges of the 1930s, the Nazi mass murders during the Second World War, and the Maoist bloodbath of the early 1950s.""","{2051, 4101, 6, 523, 1555, 1559, 4123, 2080, 4643, 1573, 4134, 4647, 3625, 1583, 2096, 561, 2122, 4682, 4688, 595, 2141, 3167, 4199, 2155, 3180, 3693, 1136, 1653, 3702, 2170, 2171, 128, 640, 1153, 4736, 4741, 4758, 4255, 4768, 2721, 2210, 2217, 188, 4800, 202, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 4313, 3805, 3299, 1765, 2798, 3833, 4859, 3842, 1803, 269, 1299, 3877, 807, 4916, 309, 311, 1847, 4920, 1865, 2891, 2896, 1873, 1372, 861, 1888, 3434, 1388, 2415, 3951, 889, 4474, 4990, 895, 4480, 3457, 386, 387, 3460, 3970, 1414, 391, 3490, 1960, 4014, 2995, 4539, 1985, 4549, 967, 5065, 971, 2507, 5077, 3040, 2529, 3564, 5106, 1526, 504, 5117}",111,"['Indonesian', 'Suharto', 'Indonesian', 'Indonesian', 'Indonesian', 'Communist Purge', 'Indonesian', '1965', 'Tragedy', 'Indonesian', 'Pembunuhan Massal', 'Indonesia', 'several months', 'Communist Party of Indonesia', 'Communist', 'Gerwani', 'Abangan Javanese', 'Chinese', 'September Movement', 'the ""New Order""', 'Cold War', 'Sukarno', ""Suharto's"", 'three-decade', 'Communists', 'the Indonesian Army', 'Communists', 'PKI', 'October 1965', 'the weeks', 'the year', 'the early months of 1966', 'Jakarta', 'Central', 'Central Java', 'East Java', 'Bali', 'Nasakom', 'PKI', 'army', 'Islam', 'March 1967', 'Sukarno', 'Indonesia', 'Parliament', 'Suharto', 'Acting', 'March 1968', 'Suharto', 'Indonesian', 'Indonesians', 'Suharto', 'the ""New Order""', 'Vigilance', ""Suharto's"", 'today', 'US', 'British', 'Sukarno', 'CIA', '1962', 'US', 'CIA', 'US', '2017', 'US', 'the Indonesian Army', 'US', 'Indonesian', 'CIA', '1968', 'the 20th century', 'Soviet', 'the 1930s', 'Nazi', 'the Second World War', 'Maoist', 'the early 1950s']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'DATE']"

This movement informed and helped shape the vigorous and polarizing debate, primarily in the United States, during the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s on how to end the war.
Many in the peace movement within the United States were students, mothers, or anti-establishment hippies. Opposition grew with participation by the African-American civil rights, women's liberation, Chicano Movements, and sectors of organized labor. Additional involvement came from many other groups, including educators, clergy, academics, journalists, lawyers, physicians—such as Benjamin Spock—and military veterans.
Their actions consisted mainly of peaceful, nonviolent events; few events were deliberately provocative and violent. In some cases, police used violent tactics against peaceful demonstrators. By 1967, according to Gallup polls, an increasing majority of Americans considered military involvement in Vietnam to be a mistake, echoed decades later by the then-head of American war planning, former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.","{1272, 3459, 1795, 2052, 3332, 7, 2568, 2955, 3979, 2066, 3091, 2964, 5010, 1307, 805, 1319, 1576, 3243, 3371, 1709, 3500, 1711, 4526, 563, 948, 4661, 1464, 1979, 4923, 4671, 2112, 4675, 580, 3524, 586, 2379, 3322, 1997, 4558, 2004, 3413, 4437, 3927, 3034, 4192, 3427, 3813, 4971, 748, 632, 889, 3578, 3195, 4605, 127}",55,"['the United States', 'New York', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Chicago', 'United States', 'the Vietnam War', '1964', 'the United States', 'the Vietnam War', 'several years', 'the United States', 'the second half of the 1960s', 'early 1970s', 'the United States', 'African-American', 'Chicano Movements', 'Benjamin Spock', '1967', 'Gallup', 'Americans', 'Vietnam', 'American', 'Defense', 'Robert McNamara']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON']"
25,1966,June,29,Vietnam War: US planes bomb the North Vietnamese capital Hanoi and the port city of Haiphong for the first time,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War,"The Vietnam War (Vietnamese: Chiến tranh Việt Nam), also known as the Second Indochina War, and in Vietnam as the Resistance War Against America (Vietnamese: Kháng chiến chống Mỹ) or simply the American War, was a conflict in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam. North Vietnam was supported by the Soviet Union, China, and other communist allies; South Vietnam was supported by the United States, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Thailand and other anti-communist allies. The war, considered a Cold War-era proxy war by some, lasted 19 years, with direct U.S. involvement ending in 1973, and included the Laotian Civil War and the Cambodian Civil War, which ended with all three countries becoming communist in 1975.
The conflict emerged from the First Indochina War against the communist-led Viet Minh. Most of the funding for the French war effort was provided by the U.S. After the French quit Indochina in 1954, the US assumed financial and military support for the South Vietnamese state. The Việt Cộng, also known as Front national de libération du Sud-Viêt Nam or NLF (the National Liberation Front), a South Vietnamese common front under the direction of North Vietnam, initiated a guerrilla war in the south. North Vietnam had also invaded Laos in the mid-1950s in support of insurgents, establishing the Ho Chi Minh Trail to supply and reinforce the Việt Cộng. U.S. involvement escalated under President John F. Kennedy through the MAAG program from just under a thousand military advisors in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963. By 1963, the North Vietnamese had sent 40,000 soldiers to fight in South Vietnam. North Vietnam was heavily backed by the USSR and the People's Republic of China. China also sent hundreds of PLA servicemen to North Vietnam to serve in air-defense and support roles.By 1964, there were 23,000 US advisors in South Vietnam. In August, the Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred, in which a U.S. destroyer was alleged to have clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft. In response, the U.S Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, giving President Lyndon B. Johnson broad authorization to increase U.S. military presence. He ordered the deployment of combat units for the first time and increased troop levels to 184,000. Past this point, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) (also known as the North Vietnamese Army or NVA) engaged in more conventional warfare with U.S and South Vietnamese forces. Every year onward, there was significant build-up of U.S forces, despite little progress. U.S Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, one of the principal architects of the war, began expressing doubts of victory by the end of 1966. U.S. and South Vietnam forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations, involving ground forces, artillery, and airstrikes. The U.S. also conducted a large-scale strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam and Laos.
The Tet Offensive of 1968 showed the lack of progress with these doctrines. With the VC and PAVN mounting large-scale urban offensives throughout 1968, U.S domestic support for the war began fading. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) expanded following a period of neglect after Tet and was modeled after U.S doctrine. The VC sustained heavy losses during the Tet Offensive and subsequent U.S.-ARVN operations in the rest of 1968, losing over 50,000 men. The CIA's Phoenix Program further degraded the VC's membership and capabilities. By the end of the year, the VC insurgents held almost no territory in South Vietnam, and their recruitment dropped by over 80% in 1969, signifying a drastic reduction in guerrilla operations, necessitating increased use of PAVN regular soldiers from the north. In 1969, North Vietnam declared a Provisional Revolutionary Government in South Vietnam in an attempt to give the reduced VC a more international stature, but the southern guerrillas from then on were sidelined as PAVN forces begun more conventional Combined arms warfare. Operations crossed national borders: Laos was invaded by North Vietnam early on, while Cambodia was used by North Vietnam as a supply route starting in 1967; the route through Cambodia began to be bombed by the U.S. in 1969, while the Laos route had been heavily bombed since 1964. The deposing of the monarch Norodom Sihanouk by the Cambodian National Assembly resulted in a PAVN invasion of the country at the request of the Khmer Rouge, escalating the Cambodian Civil War and resulting in a U.S.-RVN counter-invasion.
In 1969, following the election of U.S President Richard Nixon, a policy of ""Vietnamization"" began, which saw the conflict fought by an expanded ARVN, with U.S. forces sidelined and increasingly demoralized by domestic opposition and reduced recruitment. U.S. ground forces had largely withdrawn by early 1972 and support was limited to air support, artillery support, advisers, and materiel shipments. The ARVN, buttressed by said U.S. support, stopped the largest and first mechanized PAVN offensive to date during the Easter Offensive of 1972.The offensive resulted in heavy casualties on both sides and the failure of the PAVN to subdue South Vietnam, but the ARVN itself failed to recapture all territory, leaving its military situation difficult. The Paris Peace Accords of January 1973 saw all U.S forces withdrawn; the Case–Church Amendment, passed by the U.S Congress on 15 August 1973, officially ended direct U.S military involvement. The Peace Accords were broken almost immediately, and fighting continued for two more years. Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975 while the 1975 Spring Offensive saw the capture of Saigon by the PAVN on 30 April; this marked the end of the war, and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year.
The scale of fighting was enormous: by 1970 the ARVN was the world's fourth largest army, with the PAVN being similar in size at around a million regular soldiers. The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities (see Vietnam War casualties): estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000 to 3.8 million. Some 275,000–310,000 Cambodians, 20,000–62,000 Laotians, and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict, and a further 1,626 remain missing in action.The Sino-Soviet split re-emerged following the lull during the Vietnam War. Conflict between North Vietnam and its Cambodian allies in the Royal Government of the National Union of Kampuchea, and the newly-formed Democratic Kampuchea begun almost immediately in a series of border raids by the Khmer Rouge, eventually escalating into the Cambodian–Vietnamese War. Chinese forces directly invaded Vietnam in the Sino-Vietnamese War, with subsequent border conflicts lasting until 1991. Insurgencies were fought by the unified Vietnam in all three countries. The end of the war and resumption of the Third Indochina War would precipitate the Vietnamese boat people and the larger Indochina refugee crisis, which saw millions of refugees leave Indochina (mainly southern Vietnam), with an estimated 250,000 of whom perished at sea.

ISKCON was founded in 1966 in New York City by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Its core beliefs are based on the Hindu scriptures, particularly the Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata Purana, and the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, which has had adherents in India since the late 15th century and American and European devotees since the early 1900s.The organization was formed to spread the practice of Bhakti yoga, the practice of love of God in which those involved (bhaktas) dedicate their thoughts and actions towards pleasing Krishna, the Supreme Lord. Its most rapid expansions in membership as of 2007 have been within India and especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in Russia, Ukraine, and the rest of the ex-Soviet aligned states of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The organization is banned in Singapore.Today, it has around a million congregational members worldwide including 15 000 in the United Kingdom as of June 2019, and despite the ""relatively small number of followers in the West (around a few thousand fulltime practitioners)"", it has been described as influential.The movement has been the subject of controversies. It has been labelled a cult by anti-cult organizations. It has also been called for banning in Bangladesh by the Hefazat-e-Islam organisation. In the 1990s ISKCON faced accusations of child abuse, and its leaders acknowledged physical, emotional and sexual abuse of children who were sent to live in the movement's boarding schools in the United States and India in the 1970s and 1980s. Several safety regulations and subcommittees, such as ISKCON Resolve and the ISKCON Child Protection Office, have been developed since these allegations to ensure that  legal rights as well as the health and safety of devotees are protected unconditionally.","{4611, 1539, 2052, 1031, 2568, 1038, 1041, 2579, 3091, 2069, 1562, 1563, 28, 1566, 33, 1058, 4642, 4643, 3621, 550, 1576, 1066, 4140, 1583, 1584, 563, 565, 1591, 2104, 4154, 4671, 576, 4675, 70, 2119, 3656, 586, 4688, 2131, 1109, 1622, 2647, 2649, 3676, 608, 97, 1633, 3682, 3686, 2152, 1133, 1137, 1649, 632, 2169, 2171, 3199, 640, 1153, 1162, 2703, 3727, 663, 1178, 3228, 1183, 4255, 2721, 2210, 4768, 4774, 1192, 1193, 2221, 1711, 176, 694, 4287, 3777, 2245, 198, 1740, 1235, 3795, 4307, 1240, 1251, 3299, 1765, 3811, 3814, 4324, 2793, 748, 1272, 3833, 767, 257, 1795, 3332, 4868, 1288, 1804, 269, 4879, 287, 4895, 3365, 1830, 1319, 4905, 3371, 4400, 2865, 311, 4407, 826, 2874, 2875, 4923, 2878, 1346, 2372, 1865, 4426, 843, 2891, 4940, 2382, 2896, 2898, 2388, 2901, 854, 3927, 4437, 1372, 861, 3427, 2916, 4971, 3437, 2415, 370, 885, 1397, 3451, 4990, 4480, 4993, 3970, 3459, 900, 4994, 4487, 2955, 3979, 5003, 5010, 403, 2964, 3989, 5019, 3489, 4516, 2982, 423, 5033, 1452, 4017, 948, 2487, 1464, 1466, 1979, 1471, 452, 964, 4549, 2504, 1997, 2509, 4558, 5077, 471, 1502, 3553, 1508, 3049, 2026, 1526, 1015, 504, 4601, 3578, 4605}",196,"['A.

28,1966,December,8,US and USSR sign treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons in outer space,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons,"The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT, is an international treaty whose objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament. Between 1965 and 1968, the treaty was negotiated by the Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament, a United Nations-sponsored organization based in Geneva, Switzerland.
Opened for signature in 1968, the treaty entered into force in 1970. As required by the text, after twenty-five years, NPT Parties met in May 1995 and agreed to extend the treaty indefinitely. More countries are parties to the NPT than any other arms limitation and disarmament agreement, a testament to the treaty's significance. As of August 2016, 191 states have become parties to the treaty, though North Korea, which acceded in 1985 but never came into compliance, announced its withdrawal from the NPT in 2003, following detonation of nuclear devices in violation of core obligations. Four UN member states have never accepted the NPT, three of which possess nuclear weapons: India, Israel, and Pakistan. In addition, South Sudan, founded in 2011, has not joined.
The treaty defines nuclear-weapon states as those that have built and tested a nuclear explosive device before 1 January 1967; these are  the United States, Russia, the  United Kingdom, France, and China. Four other states are known or believed to possess nuclear weapons: India, Pakistan, and North Korea have openly tested and declared that they possess nuclear weapons, while Israel is deliberately ambiguous regarding its nuclear weapons status.
The NPT is often seen to be based on a central bargain:

the NPT non-nuclear-weapon states agree never to acquire nuclear weapons and the NPT nuclear-weapon states in exchange agree to share the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology and to pursue nuclear disarmament aimed at the ultimate elimination of their nuclear arsenals. 
The treaty is reviewed every five years in meetings called Review Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty of Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Even though the treaty was originally conceived with a limited duration of 25 years, the signing parties decided, by consensus, to unconditionally extend the treaty indefinitely during the Review Conference in New York City on 11 May 1995, in the culmination of U.S. government efforts led by Ambassador Thomas Graham Jr.
At the time the NPT was proposed, there were predictions of 25–30 nuclear weapon states within 20 years. Instead, over forty years later, five states are not parties to the NPT, and they include the only four additional states believed to possess nuclear weapons. Several additional measures have been adopted to strengthen the NPT and the broader nuclear nonproliferation regime and make it difficult for states to acquire the capability to produce nuclear weapons, including the export controls of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the enhanced verification measures of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Additional Protocol.
Critics argue that the NPT cannot stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons or the motivation to acquire them. They express disappointment with the limited progress on nuclear disarmament, where the five authorized nuclear weapons states still have 22,000 warheads in their combined stockpile and have shown a reluctance to disarm further. Several high-ranking officials within the United Nations have said that they can do little to stop states using nuclear reactors to produce nuclear weapons.","{4608, 1027, 771, 3332, 1929, 779, 140, 3083, 3980, 511, 145, 3090, 3091, 1556, 2200, 154, 2717, 4510, 1566, 4516, 3621, 1703, 3243, 3630, 3632, 4017, 4913, 2100, 565, 1464, 825, 1979, 1341, 830, 575, 1600, 3777, 3650, 1731, 580, 69, 964, 1605, 3139, 4287, 4807, 3149, 212, 3413, 2775, 2652, 1891, 484, 741, 3814, 1131, 877, 4718, 1137, 3827, 632, 2297, 3578, 2555, 4991}",65,"['US', 'USSR', 'NPT', 'Between 1965 and 1968', 'the Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament', 'United Nations', 'Geneva', 'Switzerland', '1968', '1970', 'twenty-five years', 'NPT Parties', 'May 1995', 'NPT', 'August 2016', 'North Korea', '1985', 'NPT', '2003', 'UN', 'NPT', 'India', 'Israel', 'Pakistan', 'South Sudan', '2011', '1 January 1967', 'the United States', 'Russia', 'United Kingdom', 'France', 'China', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'North Korea', 'Israel', 'NPT', 'NPT', 'NPT', 'every five years', 'Review Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty of Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons', '25 years', 'the Review Conference', 'New York City', '11 May 1995', 'U.S.', 'Thomas Graham Jr.\r\n', 'NPT', '20 years', 'forty years later', 'NPT', 'NPT', 'the Nuclear Suppliers Group', 'the International Atomic Energy Agency', 'IAEA', 'Additional Protocol', 'NPT', 'the United Nations']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'ORG', 'ORG']"

The U.S. involvement in South Vietnam stemmed from a combination of factors:  France's long colonial history in French Indochina, the US War with Japan in the Pacific, and both Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong's pledge in 1950 to support Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh's guerrilla forces.  Related to this, Roosevelt was adamantly against providing any aid to France that would in any way prop up France's struggle to maintain its pre WWII colonial empire.  However, Stalin and Mao's offering their support to the Viet Minh in 1950, changed the battlefield dynamic and geopolitical character of the struggle to one of a global conflict against Maoist and Stalinist expansionism.  It was at the time, in September 1950, that French forces began to be moderately backed by America.   Beginning with $10M USD worth of military supplies, President Harry S. Truman from that initial support provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in what was still in the minds of the Western powers French Indochina. Beginning in 1950, US involvement increased from just assisting French collision forces to providing direct military assistance to the associated states (Annam, Tonkin, Laos, and Cambodia). Eventually, U.S. missions were carried out at a more consistent rate by sending out increasing amounts of military assistance from the United States. Their main intent was to restrict Communist expansion in Indochina as they thought it would soon lead to Communist takeovers in Thailand, Laos, Malaya, and all of what later became Vietnam. This would have resulted in a change in balance of power throughout Asia. The U.S. foreign policy establishment saw national security US and Western Europe's interests being marginalized due to the rise of this Communist expansion, and thus it strived to take measures to restrict it. Under Truman the support went from $10M in September 1950 to $150M by the end of 1951.  The struggle passed from Truman to Eisenhower who saw the fall of French Indochina, and in 1961 the Eisenhower administration passed the conflict to Kennedy. In May 1961 Kennedy sent 500 more military advisers, bringing American forces there to 1,400.   With the budget increased and with American boot on the ground in Vietnam by at least 1961, these actions came to be questioned by other segments of the US government and among the people of the United States.Ultimately, estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000 to 3,812,000. Current, 2017 records, report that the conflict resulted in 58,318 US fatalities.","{4611, 7, 2568, 521, 3083, 524, 528, 4113, 3090, 20, 1562, 2589, 2590, 2078, 1566, 4642, 4134, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4647, 3630, 1584, 2104, 1081, 4671, 66, 3139, 2628, 2119, 1616, 4688, 595, 1622, 2649, 2652, 607, 608, 4192, 100, 3174, 2152, 2155, 3692, 1133, 1136, 1649, 3186, 629, 3190, 3702, 2169, 3195, 2171, 128, 640, 2176, 131, 4736, 2191, 144, 2703, 1170, 3727, 154, 4768, 2210, 2213, 3752, 174, 1711, 4785, 1204, 3777, 3268, 2764, 717, 3277, 1746, 3795, 4307, 4313, 3804, 3805, 4829, 3808, 3303, 748, 2798, 1783, 1272, 2297, 3322, 1275, 257, 3842, 771, 1795, 4871, 1292, 1808, 2322, 3348, 3869, 4895, 290, 3874, 294, 1319, 1832, 4905, 815, 4400, 4916, 311, 1847, 826, 2875, 3903, 2379, 4941, 4430, 4942, 4437, 2391, 3927, 1370, 3427, 1386, 4971, 889, 890, 1403, 3451, 4990, 4993, 3970, 3459, 3460, 4994, 903, 1929, 1931, 2955, 3979, 401, 5010, 3989, 1432, 3490, 4007, 1960, 5033, 2475, 4014, 4020, 1979, 1985, 5059, 452, 964, 1990, 4549, 5065, 971, 2507, 1997, 2508, 4558, 5067, 5077, 5079, 3544, 3034, 477, 1502, 2525, 3040, 2529, 492, 3564, 5107, 2040, 3578, 4605}",186,"['US', 'South Vietnamese', 'Operation Junction City', 'the Viet Cong', 'US', 'WWII', 'the United States', 'the Vietnam War', 'World War II', 'the Vietnam War', '1955 to 1973', 'U.S.', 'South Vietnam', 'France', 'French Indochina', 'the US War', 'Japan', 'Pacific', 'Joseph Stalin', ""Mao Zedong's"", '1950', 'Ho Chi Minh', ""the Viet Minh's"", 'Roosevelt', 'France', 'France', 'WWII', 'Stalin', 'Mao', 'the Viet Minh', '1950', 'Maoist', 'Stalinist', 'September 1950', 'French', 'America', 'Harry S.

43,1967,June,5,"Six-day war begins between Israel and the neighboring Arab states of Egypt, Jordan and Syria",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War,"The Six-Day War (Hebrew: מִלְחֶמֶת שֵׁשֶׁת הַיָּמִים, Milhemet Sheshet Ha Yamim; Arabic: النكسة, an-Naksah, ""The Setback"" or حرب 1967, Ḥarb 1967, ""War of 1967""), also known as the June War, 1967 Arab–Israeli War, or Third Arab–Israeli War, was fought between 5 and 10 June 1967 by Israel and the neighboring states of Egypt (known at the time as the United Arab Republic), Jordan, and Syria.
Relations between Israel and its neighbours were not fully normalised after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. In 1956 Israel invaded the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, with one of its objectives being the reopening of the Straits of Tiran that Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950. Israel was eventually forced to withdraw, but was guaranteed that the Straits of Tiran would remain open. A United Nations Emergency Force was deployed along the border, but there was no demilitarisation agreement.In the months prior to June 1967, tensions became dangerously heightened. Israel reiterated its post-1956 position that the closure of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping would be a cause for war (a casus belli). In May Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser announced that the straits would be closed to Israeli vessels and then mobilised its Egyptian forces along its border with Israel. On 5 June, Israel launched what it claimed were a series of preemptive airstrikes against Egyptian airfields. The question of which side caused the war is one of a number of controversies relating to the conflict.
The Egyptians were caught by surprise, and nearly the entire Egyptian air force was destroyed with few Israeli losses, giving the Israelis air supremacy. Simultaneously, the Israelis launched a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip and the Sinai, which again caught the Egyptians by surprise. After some initial resistance, Nasser ordered the evacuation of the Sinai. Israeli forces rushed westward in pursuit of the Egyptians, inflicted heavy losses, and conquered the Sinai.
Jordan had entered into a defence pact with Egypt a week before the war began; the agreement envisaged that in the event of war Jordan would not take an offensive role but would attempt to tie down Israeli forces to prevent them making territorial gains. About an hour after the Israeli air attack, the Egyptian commander of the Jordanian army was ordered by Cairo to begin attacks on Israel; in the initially confused situation, the Jordanians were told that Egypt had repelled the Israeli air strikes.
Egypt and Jordan agreed to a ceasefire on 8 June, and Syria agreed on 9 June; a ceasefire was signed with Israel on 11 June. In the aftermath of the war, Israel had crippled the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian militaries, having killed over 20,000 troops while only losing fewer than 1,000 of its own. The Israeli success was the result of a well-prepared and enacted strategy, the poor leadership of the Arab states, and their poor military leadership and strategy. Israel seized the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, from Jordan and the Golan Heights from Syria. Israel's international standing greatly improved in the following years. Its victory humiliated Egypt, Jordan and Syria, leading Nasser to resign in shame; he was later reinstated after protests in Egypt against his resignation. The speed and ease of Israel's victory would later lead to a dangerous overconfidence within the ranks of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), contributing to initial Arab successes in the subsequent 1973 Yom Kippur War, although ultimately Israeli forces were successful and defeated the Arab militaries. The displacement of civilian populations resulting from the war would have long-term consequences, as 300,000 Palestinians fled the West Bank and about 100,000 Syrians left the Golan Heights. Across the Arab world, Jewish minority communities fled or were expelled, with refugees going mainly to Israel or Europe.",set(),0,"['Six-day', 'Israel', 'Arab', 'Egypt', 'Jordan', 'Syria', 'The Six-Day War', 'Hebrew', 'Milhemet Sheshet Ha Yamim', 'Arabic', 'The Setback', 'War of 1967', 'the June War', '1967', 'Arab', 'between 5 and 10 June 1967', 'Israel', 'Egypt', 'the United Arab Republic', 'Jordan', 'Syria', 'Israel', '1948', 'Arab', '1956', 'Israel', 'Egypt', 'Straits', 'Tiran', 'Egypt', 'Israeli', '1950', 'Israel', 'Straits', 'Tiran', 'United Nations Emergency Force', 'the months prior to', 'June 1967', 'Israel', 'Straits', 'Tiran', 'Israeli', 'May', 'Egyptian', 'Gamal Abdel Nasser', 'Israeli', 'Egyptian', 'Israel', '5 June', 'Israel', 'Egyptian', 'Egyptians', 'Egyptian', 'Israeli', 'Israelis', 'Israelis', 'the Gaza Strip', 'Sinai', 'Egyptians', 'Nasser', 'Sinai', 'Israeli', 'Egyptians', 'Sinai', 'Jordan', 'Egypt', 'Jordan', 'Israeli', 'Israeli', 'Egyptian', 'the Jordanian army', 'Cairo', 'Israel', 'Jordanians', 'Egypt', 'Israeli', 'Egypt', 'Jordan', '8 June', 'Syria', '9 June', 'Israel', '11 June', 'Israel', 'Egyptian', 'Syrian', 'Jordanian', 'Israeli', 'Arab', 'Israel', 'the Gaza Strip', 'the Sinai Peninsula', 'Egypt', 'the West Bank', 'East Jerusalem', 'Jordan', 'the Golan Heights', 'Syria', 'Israel', 'the following years', 'Egypt', 'Jordan', 'Syria', 'Nasser', 'Egypt', 'Israel', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Arab', '1973', 'Yom Kippur War', 'Israeli', 'Arab', 'Palestinians', 'the West Bank', 'Syrians', 'the Golan Heights', 'Arab', 'Jewish', 'Israel', 'Europe']","['DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'LANGUAGE', 'ORG', 'LANGUAGE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'LOC']"
44,1967,July,6,Nigerian Civil War erupts as Nigerian forces invade the secessionist state of Biafra,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Civil_War,"The Nigerian Civil War (also known as the Biafran War and the Nigerian-Biafran War) was a civil war in Nigeria fought between the government of Nigeria and the secessionist state of Biafra from 6 July 1967 to 15 January 1970. Biafra represented nationalist aspirations of the Igbo people, whose leadership felt they could no longer coexist with the Northern-dominated federal government. The conflict resulted from political, economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions which preceded Britain's formal decolonization of Nigeria from 1960 to 1963. Immediate causes of the war in 1966 included ethno-religious riots in Northern Nigeria, a military coup, a counter-coup and persecution of Igbo living in Northern Nigeria. Control over the lucrative oil production in the Niger Delta played a vital strategic role.
Within a year, the Federal Government troops surrounded Biafra, capturing coastal oil facilities and the city of Port Harcourt. The blockade imposed during the ensuing stalemate led to mass starvation. During the two and half years of the war, there were about 100,000 overall military casualties, while between 500,000 and 2 million Biafran civilians died of starvation.In mid-1968, images of malnourished and starving Biafran children saturated the mass media of Western countries. The plight of the starving Biafrans became a cause célèbre in foreign countries, enabling a significant rise in the funding and prominence of international non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union were the main supporters of the Nigerian government, while France, Israel and some other countries supported Biafra.","{3970, 2051, 387, 3459, 2568, 2955, 3468, 3979, 1678, 2322, 3862, 1177, 5019, 4768, 2210, 4770, 2342, 3882, 3243, 3244, 4526, 563, 2355, 2483, 4661, 4407, 1475, 3524, 1739, 2507, 4430, 4307, 3413, 3542, 3803, 2141, 1888, 1890, 3812, 4971, 1646, 1136, 2039, 4986, 2171, 892}",46,"['Nigerian Civil War', 'Nigerian', 'Biafra', 'The Nigerian Civil War', 'the Biafran War', 'Nigerian-Biafran War', 'Nigeria', 'Nigeria', 'Biafra', '6 July 1967', 'January 1970', 'Biafra', 'Igbo', 'Britain', 'Nigeria', '1960 to 1963', '1966', 'Northern Nigeria', 'Northern Nigeria', 'Niger Delta', 'a year', 'the Federal Government', 'Biafra', 'Port Harcourt', 'the two and half years', 'Biafran', 'mid-1968', 'Biafran', 'Western', 'Biafrans', 'The United Kingdom', 'the Soviet Union', 'Nigerian', 'France', 'Israel', 'Biafra']","['EVENT', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON']"
45,1967,November,28,1st radio pulsars detected by British postgraduate Jocelyn Bell Burnell and her supervisor Antony Hewish at Cambridge University,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Bell_Burnell,"Dame Susan Jocelyn Bell Burnell  (; born 15 July 1943) is an astrophysicist from Northern Ireland who, as a postgraduate student, co-discovered the first radio pulsars in 1967. She was credited with ""one of the most significant scientific achievements of the 20th century"". The discovery was recognised by the award of the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics, but despite the fact that she was the first to observe the pulsars, Bell was not one of the recipients of the prize.The paper announcing the discovery of pulsars had five authors. Bell's thesis supervisor Antony Hewish was listed first, Bell second. Hewish was awarded the Nobel Prize, along with the astronomer Martin Ryle. Many prominent astronomers criticised Bell's omission, including Sir Fred Hoyle. In 1977, Bell Burnell played down this controversy, saying, ""I believe it would demean Nobel Prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases, and I do not believe this is one of them."" The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, in its press release announcing the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics, cited Ryle and Hewish for their pioneering work in radio-astrophysics, with particular mention of Ryle's work on aperture-synthesis technique, and Hewish's decisive role in the discovery of pulsars.
Bell Burnell served as president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 2002 to 2004, as president of the Institute of Physics from October 2008 until October 2010, and as interim president of the Institute following the death of her successor, Marshall Stoneham, in early 2011.
In 2018, she was awarded the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics. Following the announcement of the award, she decided to give the whole of the £2.3 million prize money to help female, minority, and refugee students seeking to become physics researchers, the funds to be administered by the Institute of Physics.

46,1967,December,3,1st human heart transplant performed in South Africa by Dr Christiaan Barnard on Louis Washkansky,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation,"A heart transplant, or a cardiac transplant, is a surgical transplant procedure performed on patients with end-stage heart failure or severe coronary artery disease when other medical or surgical treatments have failed. As of 2018, the most common procedure is to take a functioning heart, with or without both lungs, from a recently deceased organ donor (brain death is the standard) and implanting it into the patient. The patient's own heart is either removed and replaced with the donor heart (orthotopic procedure) or, much less commonly, the recipient's diseased heart is left in place to support the donor heart (heterotopic, or ""piggyback"", transplant procedure).
Approximately 3,500 heart transplants are performed each year worldwide, more than half of which are in the US. Post-operative survival periods average 15 years. Heart transplantation is not considered to be a cure for heart disease; rather it is a life-saving treatment intended to improve the quality and duration of life for a recipient.","{2568, 521, 3083, 4113, 3090, 2589, 2078, 1058, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 3630, 1584, 2104, 1081, 4688, 1622, 2649, 3163, 2141, 4192, 2152, 619, 2155, 3693, 1646, 1649, 2169, 2682, 3195, 127, 640, 1678, 2703, 144, 3727, 1177, 2213, 1739, 2764, 717, 3795, 4307, 3285, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3812, 3813, 3303, 4330, 1275, 1292, 1808, 4895, 294, 4905, 311, 4920, 3903, 4430, 4942, 2388, 1888, 4971, 4472, 892, 4993, 4994, 387, 3979, 2964, 1432, 4014, 2483, 4024, 1979, 5059, 452, 964, 4549, 2508, 1997, 4051, 5079, 3034, 1502, 4589, 5107, 2040}",91,"['1st', 'South Africa', 'Christiaan Barnard', 'Louis Washkansky', '2018', 'each year', 'US', '15 years']","['DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE']"

The program, originally created by Robert ""Nick"" Nicholson and E. Roger Muir (credited on-screen as Roger E. Muir) and produced by Chuck Barris, has appeared in many different versions since its 1966 debut. The show became famous for some of the arguments that couples had over incorrect answers in the form of mistaken predictions, and it even led to some divorces.Many of The Newlywed Game's questions dealt with ""making whoopee"", the euphemism that producers used for sexual intercourse to circumvent network censorship. However, it became such a catchphrase of the show that its original host, Bob Eubanks, continued to use the phrase throughout the show's many runs, even in the 1980s and 1990s episodes and beyond, when he could easily have said ""make love"" or ""have sex"" during these periods without censorship.

Robert Towne and Beatty provided uncredited contributions to the script; Beatty produced the film. The soundtrack was composed by Charles Strouse.
Bonnie and Clyde is considered one of the first films of the New Hollywood era and a landmark film. It broke many cinematic taboos and for some members of the counterculture, the film was considered to be a ""rallying cry."" Its success prompted other filmmakers to be more open in presenting sex and violence in their films. The film's ending became iconic as ""one of the bloodiest death scenes in cinematic history.""The film received Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress (Estelle Parsons) and Best Cinematography (Burnett Guffey).

It was produced by QM Productions and United Artists Television. It aired on ABC from September 1963 to August 1967. David Janssen starred as Dr. Richard Kimble, a physician who is wrongfully convicted of his wife's murder and sentenced to receive the death penalty. En route to death row, Dr. Richard Kimble's train derails over a switch, allowing him to escape and begin a cross-country search for the real killer, a ""one-armed man"" (played by Bill Raisch). At the same time, Dr. Kimble is hounded by the authorities, most notably by Police Lieutenant Philip Gerard (Barry Morse).
The Fugitive aired for four seasons, and a total of 120 episodes, each 51 minutes, were produced.

51,1967,March,31,1st time Jimi Hendrix burns his guitar (London),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix,"James Marshall ""Jimi"" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career lasted only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential guitarists in history and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as ""the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music"".Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at age 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army and trained as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division, but he was discharged the following year. He moved to Clarksville, Tennessee soon after and began playing gigs on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by Linda Keith, who interested bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming his first manager. Within months, Hendrix earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: ""Hey Joe"", ""Purple Haze"", and ""The Wind Cries Mary"". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and his third and final studio album Electric Ladyland reached number one in the US in 1968; it was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his only number-one album. He was the world's highest-paid performer, and he headlined the Woodstock festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970. He died from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970, at age 27.
Hendrix was inspired by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering effects units in mainstream rock, such as fuzz distortion, Octavia, wah-wah, and Uni-Vibe. He was the first musician to use stereophonic phasing effects in recordings. Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone writes: ""Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.""In 1967, readers of Melody Maker voted Hendrix the Pop Musician of the Year, and Rolling Stone declared him the Performer of the Year in 1968. Disc and Music Echo magazine honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969, and Guitar Player named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year in 1970. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Rolling Stone ranked the band's three studio albums among the 100 greatest albums of all time, and ranked Hendrix the greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist of all time.","{128, 1025, 387, 2051, 4101, 1422, 1295, 656, 1808, 3989, 3862, 4758, 1432, 1177, 290, 418, 36, 1573, 1699, 167, 807, 4007, 810, 4134, 4647, 4014, 2096, 1201, 690, 2995, 311, 1847, 826, 699, 4539, 2628, 4549, 1990, 967, 4682, 202, 971, 1739, 2122, 2507, 3277, 336, 1616, 4174, 595, 4430, 4815, 5074, 4313, 3803, 2141, 3040, 2529, 2018, 3812, 4199, 873, 3434, 2155, 1388, 3180, 1646, 1136, 5106, 1653, 2169, 4474, 4859, 5117}",74,"['Jimi Hendrix', 'London', 'James Marshall ""Jimi"" Hendrix', 'Johnny Allen Hendrix', 'November 27, 1942', 'September 18, 1970', 'American', 'only four years', 'the 20th century', 'The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame', 'Seattle', 'Washington', 'Hendrix', 'age 15', '1961', 'the US Army', 'the 101st Airborne Division', 'the following year', 'Clarksville', 'Tennessee', ""the Chitlin' Circuit"", ""the Isley Brothers'"", 'Little Richard', 'mid-1965', 'Curtis', 'Knight', 'England', 'late 1966', 'Linda Keith', 'Chas Chandler', 'months', 'Hendrix', 'UK', 'the Jimi Hendrix Experience', 'Joe', 'The Wind Cries Mary', 'US', 'the Monterey Pop Festival', '1967', 'US', '1968', 'Hendrix', 'the Woodstock festival', '1969', 'the Isle of Wight Festival', '1970', 'September 18, 1970', 'age 27', 'American', 'Octavia', 'Uni-Vibe', 'Holly George-Warren', 'Rolling Stone', 'Hendrix', 'Hendrix', '1967', 'Melody Maker', 'Hendrix the Pop Musician', 'the Year', 'Rolling Stone', 'the Performer of the Year', '1968', 'Music Echo', 'the World Top Musician', '1969', 'Guitar Player', 'the Rock Guitarist of the Year in 1970', 'The Jimi Hendrix Experience', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame', '1992', 'the UK Music Hall of Fame', '2005', 'Rolling Stone', 'Hendrix']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG']"
52,1967,April,29,"""Respect"" single released by Aretha Franklin (Billboard Song of the Year 1967)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respect_(song),"""Respect"" is a song written and originally released by American recording artist Otis Redding in 1965. The song became a 1967 hit and signature song for soul singer Aretha Franklin. The music in the two versions is significantly different, and through a few changes in the lyrics, the stories told by the songs have a different flavor. Redding's version is a plea from a desperate man, who will give his woman anything she wants. He won't care if she does him wrong, as long as he gets his due respect when he brings money home. However, Franklin's version is a declaration from a strong, confident woman, who knows that she has everything her man wants. She never does him wrong, and demands his ""respect"". Franklin's version adds the ""R-E-S-P-E-C-T"" chorus and the backup singers' refrain of ""Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me..."".
Franklin's cover was a landmark for the feminist movement, and is often considered one of the best songs of the R&B era, earning her two Grammy Awards in 1968 for ""Best Rhythm & Blues Recording"" and ""Best Rhythm & Blues Solo Vocal Performance, Female"", and was inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1987. In 2002, the Library of Congress honored Franklin's version by adding it to the National Recording Registry. It was placed number five on Rolling Stone magazine's list of ""The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time"". It was also included in the list of ""Songs of the Century"", by the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment for the Arts.

Track Records first released it in the United Kingdom in December 1967, only seven months after the release of the group's highly successful debut, Are You Experienced. In the United States, Reprise Records delayed the release until the following month. The album reached the top ten in the album charts in both countries.
For the album, the group displayed several musical styles and critics saw it as demonstrating Jimi Hendrix's growth as a songwriter. The album introduced ""Spanish Castle Magic"" and ""Little Wing"", two Hendrix compositions which draw on his roots performing with rhythm and blues bands, that would remain in his live repertoire throughout his career.  
The album cover, which draws on Hindu religious iconography, has generated controversy. It was designed without Hendrix's approval, and he publicly expressed his dissatisfaction.

54,1967,May,26,"EMI releases ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" a few days early in the UK; it would go to number one for 15 weeks in the US and 22 weeks in the UK",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band,"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart and 15 weeks at number one on the Billboard Top LPs chart in the US. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture. It won four Grammy Awards in 1968, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honour.
In August 1966, the Beatles permanently retired from touring and began a three-month holiday. During a return flight to London in November, Paul McCartney had an idea for a song involving an Edwardian military band that formed the impetus of the Sgt. Pepper concept. Sessions began on 24 November at EMI Studios with two compositions inspired by the Beatles' youth, ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""Penny Lane"", but after pressure from EMI, the songs were released as a double A-side single and left off the album.
In February 1967, after recording the title track, McCartney suggested that the album represent a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band. This alter ego group further inspired the band to experiment artistically. During the recording sessions, there was no thought of reproducing the songs in concert, and the band were free to continue the technological experimentation marked by their previous album Revolver, this time without an absolute deadline for completion. With producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick, the group approached the studio as an instrument, colouring much of the recordings with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"" and ""A Day in the Life"". Recording was completed on 21 April 1967. The cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a tableau of celebrities and historical figures, was designed by the pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth.
Sgt. Pepper is regarded by musicologists as an early concept album that advanced the use of extended form in popular music while continuing the artistic maturation seen on the Beatles' preceding releases. An important work of British psychedelia, the album incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including vaudeville, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. It is described as one of the first art rock LPs, a progenitor to progressive rock, and the starting point of the album era. In 2003, the Library of Congress placed Sgt. Pepper in the National Recording Registry as ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Rolling Stone ranked it as the greatest album of all time. It is one of the best-selling albums of all time, with more than 32 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011, and remains the UK's best-selling studio album. Professor Kevin Dettmar, writing in The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature, described it as ""the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded"".","{7, 2568, 521, 3083, 524, 1037, 3597, 528, 4113, 3090, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1058, 4642, 4134, 39, 1576, 551, 2601, 4138, 4140, 4647, 3630, 1583, 1584, 565, 1591, 2104, 1081, 576, 3139, 2628, 2119, 4688, 1622, 2647, 2649, 3163, 3676, 4192, 2152, 619, 2155, 3693, 1136, 1649, 2169, 3195, 2171, 640, 2176, 1162, 3722, 4235, 2191, 144, 2703, 1170, 3727, 661, 154, 4768, 2721, 3234, 677, 2213, 1192, 174, 3252, 694, 703, 3777, 1732, 3272, 2764, 717, 3277, 3795, 4307, 3285, 3803, 3804, 1757, 3805, 3808, 1251, 2278, 3303, 2793, 234, 4330, 4845, 1783, 3322, 1275, 257, 3842, 771, 4871, 1288, 1292, 4879, 1808, 4895, 2337, 3874, 4899, 294, 4905, 3371, 3886, 4916, 311, 4407, 2875, 4923, 1341, 4413, 3903, 1857, 3908, 843, 844, 2379, 2891, 4430, 4940, 4941, 4942, 2388, 2901, 854, 3927, 4445, 352, 1386, 4971, 2415, 370, 4472, 889, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 2955, 3979, 1424, 401, 3989, 1432, 3999, 3489, 418, 2982, 2475, 4014, 4020, 4024, 1465, 1979, 5059, 452, 4549, 2507, 2508, 1997, 5067, 463, 4563, 2004, 5077, 5079, 3034, 987, 478, 990, 1502, 3040, 1508, 2026, 492, 4589, 5107, 1526, 2040, 3578, 4605}",189,"['EMI', ""Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", 'a few days early', 'UK', '15 weeks', 'US', '22 weeks', 'UK', ""Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", 'English', 'Beatles', 'May 1967', 'the United Kingdom', 'June 1967', 'the United States', '27 weeks', 'UK', '15 weeks', 'US', 'Grammy Awards', '1968', 'Album', 'August 1966', 'Beatles', 'three-month', 'London', 'November', 'Paul McCartney', 'Edwardian', 'Sgt', '24 November', 'EMI Studios', 'Beatles', 'Strawberry Fields Forever', 'Penny Lane', 'EMI', 'February 1967', 'McCartney', 'Sgt', 'Revolver', 'George Martin', 'Geoff Emerick', 'Lucy', 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite', '21 April 1967', 'Beatles', 'Peter Blake', 'Jann Haworth', 'Beatles', 'British', 'Western', 'Indian', '2003', 'Congress', 'Sgt', 'the National Recording Registry', 'Rolling Stone', '2011', 'UK', 'Kevin Dettmar', 'The Oxford Encyclopedia', 'British']","['ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP']"

She first won attention for her role in Fantastic Voyage (1966), after which she won a contract with 20th Century Fox. They lent her contract to the British studio Hammer Film Productions, for whom she made One Million Years B.C. (1966). Although she had only three lines of dialogue in the film, images of her in the doe-skin bikini which she wore became best-selling posters that turned her into an international sex symbol. She later starred in notable films including Bedazzled (1967), Bandolero! (1968), 100 Rifles (1969), Myra Breckinridge (1970) and Hannie Caulder (1971). She made several television variety specials.
Welch's unique film persona made her an icon of the 1960s and 1970s, due to her portrayal of strong female characters and breaking the mold of the archetypal sex symbol. Because of this, her rise to stardom in the mid 1960s was partly credited with ending Hollywood's vigorous promotion of the blonde bombshell. She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Actress in a Musical or Comedy in 1974 for her performance in The Three Musketeers. She was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Television Film for her performance in the film Right to Die (1987). In 1995, Welch was chosen by Empire magazine as one of the ""100 Sexiest Stars in Film History"". Playboy ranked Welch No. 3 on their ""100 Sexiest Stars of the Twentieth Century"" list. In 2011, Men's Health ranked her No. 2 in its ""Hottest Women of All Time"" list.","{4611, 1539, 519, 2568, 524, 528, 2590, 1566, 4642, 1576, 563, 1081, 4671, 584, 4174, 1133, 1649, 3702, 2169, 2171, 3195, 128, 640, 4736, 4235, 2703, 3727, 4763, 157, 4768, 2210, 174, 1711, 4785, 690, 3777, 1222, 3795, 4307, 4829, 748, 4845, 3834, 1795, 4890, 4895, 290, 3874, 3365, 1319, 2856, 4905, 4400, 1847, 826, 2875, 4413, 4944, 3934, 352, 1898, 4971, 3954, 4474, 4990, 386, 3459, 4994, 903, 3463, 1432, 5019, 5033, 2489, 452, 964, 4549, 971, 2507, 2508, 5077, 3034, 2525, 2529, 2018, 5097}",86,"['Raquel Welch', 'Patrick Curtis', 'Paris', 'Raquel Welch', 'Jo Raquel Tejada', 'September 5, 1940', 'American', 'Fantastic Voyage', '1966', '20th Century Fox', 'British', 'Hammer Film Productions', '1966', 'doe', 'Bedazzled', '1967', 'Bandolero', '1968', '1969', 'Myra Breckinridge', '1970', 'Hannie Caulder', '1971', 'Welch', '1960s', '1970s', 'the mid 1960s', 'Hollywood', '1974', 'The Three Musketeers', 'Golden Globe Award for', 'Right to Die', '1987', '1995', 'Welch', 'Empire', 'Sexiest Stars in Film History', 'Playboy', 'Welch', 'Sexiest Stars of the Twentieth Century', '2011', ""Men's Health"", 'Hottest Women of All Time']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PRODUCT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART']"

He was called ""the natural successor to Olivier"" by critic and dramaturge Kenneth Tynan. An alcoholic, Burton's failure to live up to those expectations disappointed critics and colleagues and fuelled his legend as a great thespian wastrel.Burton was nominated for an Academy Award seven times, but never won an Oscar. He was a recipient of BAFTAs, Golden Globes, and Tony Awards for Best Actor. In the mid-1960s, Burton ascended into the ranks of the top box office stars. By the late 1960s, Burton was one of the highest-paid actors in the world, receiving fees of $1 million or more plus a share of the gross receipts.

He was rushed to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he died at 7:05 p.m. He was a prominent leader of the Civil Rights Movement and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who was known for his use of nonviolence and civil disobedience.
James Earl Ray, a fugitive from the Missouri State Penitentiary, was arrested on June 8, 1968, in London at Heathrow Airport, extradited to the United States, and charged with the crime. On March 10, 1969, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 99 years in the Tennessee State Penitentiary. He later made many attempts to withdraw his guilty plea and be tried by a jury, but was unsuccessful; he died in prison in 1998.The King family and others believe the assassination was the result of a conspiracy involving the U.S. government, Mafia and Memphis police, as alleged by Loyd Jowers in 1993. They believe that Ray was a scapegoat. In 1999, the family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Jowers for the sum of $10 million. During closing arguments, their attorney asked the jury to award damages of $100, to make the point that ""it was not about the money."" During the trial, both sides presented evidence alleging a government conspiracy. The government agencies accused could not defend themselves or respond because they were not named as defendants. Based on the evidence, the jury concluded Jowers and others were ""part of a conspiracy to kill King"" and awarded the family $100. The allegations and the finding of the Memphis jury were later rejected by the United States Department of Justice in 2000 due to lack of evidence.","{4611, 2051, 4101, 7, 2568, 521, 4113, 3090, 2078, 1058, 4642, 1573, 39, 1576, 2601, 4647, 3630, 4661, 2104, 1081, 4671, 2112, 1090, 3139, 1095, 4682, 590, 1616, 4688, 3666, 595, 1622, 2649, 3163, 2141, 2155, 621, 1646, 3693, 1136, 1649, 4726, 2169, 2682, 3195, 2170, 2171, 127, 640, 131, 4235, 1678, 2703, 144, 656, 1170, 3727, 4758, 1177, 4768, 2210, 1699, 2213, 3243, 1709, 182, 703, 1222, 1739, 2764, 717, 3277, 3795, 4307, 3285, 4313, 3803, 3805, 3808, 3812, 3813, 3303, 4330, 748, 1272, 3322, 1275, 4859, 3842, 1795, 1292, 4879, 1808, 3862, 1817, 1819, 3869, 1822, 4895, 805, 294, 807, 4905, 4916, 309, 3381, 311, 4920, 826, 4923, 1341, 4413, 3903, 1857, 2891, 4940, 4941, 4430, 4942, 2388, 3413, 3927, 4445, 352, 1888, 1890, 1386, 875, 1388, 4971, 882, 4472, 889, 4474, 3451, 4990, 4993, 3970, 387, 3459, 3460, 4994, 2955, 3979, 1938, 1432, 418, 4007, 936, 5033, 4526, 2483, 2995, 4024, 1465, 4539, 5059, 452, 964, 965, 967, 968, 1990, 3524, 971, 2508, 1997, 4549, 5065, 5067, 5074, 4051, 2004, 5077, 5079, 3034, 987, 1502, 3040, 2018, 492, 4589, 5107, 2040, 3578, 4605}",186,"['US', 'Martin Luther King Jr.', 'Memphis', 'Tennessee', 'Martin Luther King Jr.', 'American', 'the Lorraine Motel', 'Memphis', 'Tennessee', 'April 4, 1968', ""St. Joseph's"", 'the Civil Rights Movement', 'a Nobel Peace Prize', 'James Earl Ray', 'the Missouri State Penitentiary', 'June 8, 1968', 'London', 'Heathrow Airport', 'the United States', 'March 10, 1969', '99 years', 'the Tennessee State Penitentiary', 'King', 'U.S.', 'Mafia', 'Memphis', 'Loyd Jowers', '1993', 'Ray', '1999', 'Jowers', 'Memphis', 'the United States Department of Justice', '2000']","['GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE']"
65,1968,April,11,US President Lyndon B. Johnson signs 1968 Civil Rights Act,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1968,"The Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Pub.L. 90–284, 82 Stat. 73, enacted April 11, 1968) is a landmark law in the United States signed into law by United States President Lyndon B. Johnson during the King assassination riots.
Titles II through VII comprise the Indian Civil Rights Act, which applies to the Native American tribes of the United States and makes many but not all of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights applicable within the tribes (that Act appears today in Title 25, sections 1301 to 1303 of the United States Code).
Titles VIII through IX are commonly known as the Fair Housing Act (FHA), which was meant as a follow‑up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (this is different legislation than the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, which expanded housing funding programs). While the Civil Rights Act of 1866 prohibited discrimination in housing, there were no federal enforcement provisions. The 1968 act expanded on previous acts and prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion, national origin, and since 1974, sex. Since 1988, the act protects people with disabilities and families with children. Pregnant women are also protected from illegal discrimination because they have been given familial status with their unborn child being the other family member. Victims of discrimination may use both the 1968 act and the 1866 act's section 1983 to seek redress. The 1968 act provides for federal solutions while the 1866 act provides for private solutions (i.e., civil suits). The act also made it a federal crime to ""by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone... by reason of their race, color, religion, or national origin, handicap or familial status.""Title X, commonly known as the Anti-Riot Act, makes it a felony to ""travel in interstate commerce...with the intent to incite, promote, encourage, participate in and carry on a riot.""

66,1968,April,20,"British politician Enoch Powell makes his controversial ""Rivers of Blood"" speech",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch_Powell,"John Enoch Powell  (16 June 1912 – 8 February 1998) was a British politician, classical scholar, author, linguist, soldier, philologist and poet. He served as a Conservative Member of Parliament (1950–1974), then Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MP (1974–1987), and was Minister of Health (1960–1963).
Before entering politics, Powell was a classical scholar, becoming a full professor of Ancient Greek at the age of 25 in Australia.  During World War II, he served in both staff and intelligence positions, reaching the rank of brigadier in his early thirties. He also wrote poetry (published as early as 1937), as well as many books on classical and political subjects.
Powell attracted widespread attention following his 20 April 1968 address to the General Meeting of the West Midlands Area Conservative Political Centre, which became known as the ""Rivers of Blood"" speech. It criticised then-current rates of immigration into the UK, especially from the New Commonwealth, and opposed the then-proposed anti-discrimination legislation Race Relations Bill. In response, Conservative Party leader Edward Heath sacked Powell from his position as Shadow Defence Secretary (1965–1968) in the Conservative opposition. The speech was immediately considered by many as a blatant demonstration of racism, drawing sharp criticism from his own party and from the press. While Powell did not consider himself a racist, The Economist claimed in an editorial on the 50th anniversary of the speech that his rhetoric had a ""lasting and malign effect ... on the way in which race and migration are discussed, or not discussed"".In the aftermath of the ""Rivers of Blood"" speech, several polls suggested that between 67 and 82 per cent of the UK population agreed with Powell's opinions. His supporters claimed that the large public following which Powell attracted helped the Conservatives to win the 1970 general election, and perhaps cost them the February 1974 general election, when Powell turned his back on the Conservatives by endorsing a vote for Labour, which returned as a minority government in early March following a hung parliament.
Powell was returned to the House of Commons in October 1974 as the Ulster Unionist Party MP for the Northern Irish constituency of South Down. He represented the constituency until he was defeated at the 1987 general election.","{7, 524, 528, 3090, 3613, 4134, 561, 563, 2104, 2122, 4682, 3154, 595, 3666, 1622, 2649, 2150, 2152, 3180, 1649, 2169, 2171, 3195, 640, 4605, 4235, 2703, 1168, 3727, 4768, 2210, 174, 4785, 182, 4815, 3795, 4307, 4829, 4845, 1783, 3322, 3834, 3842, 3348, 4895, 290, 3874, 3365, 4905, 2875, 4413, 2891, 4942, 358, 4971, 375, 889, 4474, 3451, 3970, 4994, 2955, 3468, 3989, 1432, 5019, 3490, 4020, 4024, 4539, 452, 4549, 967, 971, 2507, 3034, 2525, 3564, 4589, 5107, 5117}",81,"['British', 'Enoch Powell', 'Rivers of Blood', 'John Enoch Powell', '16 June 1912', 'February 1998', 'British', 'Conservative', 'Parliament', 'Ulster Unionist Party', 'Powell', 'Ancient Greek', 'the age of 25', 'Australia', 'World War II', 'Powell', 'April 1968', 'the ""Rivers of Blood', 'UK', 'the New Commonwealth', 'Conservative Party', 'Edward Heath', 'Powell', 'Powell', 'Economist', 'the ""Rivers of Blood""', 'UK', 'Powell', 'Powell', 'Conservatives', '1970', 'February 1974', 'Powell', 'Conservatives', 'Labour', 'early March', 'Powell', 'the House of Commons', 'October 1974', 'the Ulster Unionist Party', 'Northern Irish', 'South Down', '1987']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE']"
67,1968,April,23,"1st decimal coins issued in Britain (5 & 10 new pence, replacing shilling and two-shilling pieces)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_of_the_pound_sterling,"The standard circulating coinage of the United Kingdom is denominated in pounds sterling (symbol ""£""), and, since the introduction of the two-pound coin in 1994 (to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Bank of England 1694–1994), ranges in value from one penny to two pounds. Since decimalisation, on 15 February 1971, the pound has been divided into 100 (new) pence. Before decimalisation, twelve pence made a shilling, and twenty shillings made a pound. British coins are minted by the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Wales. The Royal Mint also commissions the coins' designs.
As of 31 March 2016, there were an estimated 30.14 billion coins circulating in the United Kingdom.The first decimal coins were circulated in 1968. These were the five pence (5p) and ten pence (10p), and had values of one shilling (1/-) and two shillings (2/-), respectively, under the pre-decimal £sd system. The decimal coins are minted in copper-plated steel (previously bronze), nickel-plated steel, cupronickel and nickel-brass. The two-pound coins, and, as from 28 March 2017 the new one-pound coins, are bimetallic. The coins are discs, except for the twenty pence and fifty pence pieces, both of which have faces that are heptagonal curves of constant width, and the new one-pound coins, which have twelve edges. All the circulating coins have an effigy of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse, and various national and regional designs, and the denomination, on the reverse. The circulating coins, excepting the two-pound coin, were redesigned in 2008, keeping the sizes and compositions unchanged, but introducing reverse designs that each depict a part of the Royal Shield of Arms and form (most of) the whole shield when they are placed together in the appropriate arrangement. The exception, the 2008 one-pound coin, depicts the entire shield of arms on the reverse. All current coins carry a Latin inscription whose full form is ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA FIDEI DEFENSATRIX, meaning ""Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Queen and Defender of the Faith"".
In addition to the circulating coinage, the UK also mints commemorative decimal coins (crowns) in the denomination of five pounds. Prior to decimalisation, the denomination of special commemorative coins was five shillings, that is, ​1⁄4 of a pound. Crowns, therefore, had a face value of 25p from decimalisation until 1981, when the last 25p crown was struck. Ceremonial Maundy money and bullion coinage of gold sovereigns, half sovereigns, and gold and silver Britannia coins are also produced.
Some territories outside the United Kingdom, which use the pound sterling, produce their own coinage, with the same denominations and specifications as the UK coinage but with local designs.
In the years just before decimalisation, the circulating British coins were the half crown (2/6, withdrawn 1 January 1970), two shillings or florin (2/-), shilling (1/-), sixpence (6d), threepence (3d), penny (1d) and halfpenny (​1⁄2d). The farthing (​1⁄4d) had been withdrawn on 1 January 1961. There was also the Crown (5/-), worth 25p; it was, and still is, legal tender, but normally did not circulate.
All modern coins feature a profile of the current monarch's head. The direction in which they face changes with each successive monarch, a pattern that began with the Stuarts. For the Tudors and pre-Restoration Stuarts, both left and right-facing portrait images were minted within the reign of a single monarch. In the Middle Ages, portrait images tended to be full face.
From a very early date, British coins have been inscribed with the name of the ruler of the kingdom in which they were produced, and a longer or shorter title, always in Latin; among the earliest distinctive English coins are the silver pennies of Offa of Mercia, which were inscribed with the legend OFFA REX, ""King Offa"". The English silver penny was derived from another silver coin, the sceat, of 20 troy grains weight, which was in general circulation in Europe during the Middle Ages. In the 12th century, Henry II established the sterling silver standard for English coinage, of 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper, replacing the earlier use of fine silver in the Middle Ages. The coinage reform of 1816 set up a weight/value ratio and physical sizes for silver coins. Silver was eliminated from coins, except Maundy coins, in 1947.",set(),0,"['Britain', 'the United Kingdom', '1994', '300th', 'the Bank of England', '15 February 1971', 'British', 'the Royal Mint', 'Llantrisant', 'Wales', 'The Royal Mint', '31 March 2016', 'the United Kingdom', '1968', '28 March 2017', 'Queen Elizabeth II', '2008', 'the Royal Shield of Arms', '2008', 'Latin', 'ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA FIDEI DEFENSATRIX', 'Elizabeth II', 'Queen', 'UK', '\u200b1⁄4', '25p', '1981', 'Britannia', 'the United Kingdom', 'UK', 'the years', 'British', '1 January 1970', '1 January 1961', 'Crown', 'Stuarts', 'Tudors', 'the Middle Ages', 'a very early date', 'British', 'Latin', 'English', 'Mercia', 'King Offa', 'English', 'troy', 'Europe', 'the Middle Ages', 'the 12th century', 'Henry II', 'English', '92.5%', '7.5%', 'the Middle Ages', '1816', 'Maundy', '1947']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERCENT', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE']"

69,1968,August,20,"During the night 250,000 Soviet and Warsaw Pact troops invade Czechoslovakia in response to the Prague Spring",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact_invasion_of_Czechoslovakia,"The Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, officially known as Operation Danube, was a joint invasion of Czechoslovakia by five Warsaw Pact countries – the Soviet Union, Poland, Bulgaria, East Germany and Hungary – on the night of 20–21 August 1968. Approximately 250,000 Warsaw pact troops attacked Czechoslovakia that night, with Romania and Albania refusing to participate. East German forces, except for a small number of specialists, did not participate in the invasion because they were ordered from Moscow not to cross the Czechoslovak border just hours before the invasion. 137 Czechoslovakian civilians were killed and 500 seriously wounded during the occupation.The invasion successfully stopped Alexander Dubček's Prague Spring liberalisation reforms and strengthened the authority of the authoritarian wing within the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ). The foreign policy of the Soviet Union during this era was known as the Brezhnev Doctrine.Public reaction to the invasion was widespread and divided. Although the majority of the Warsaw Pact supported the invasion along with several other communist parties worldwide, Western nations, along with Albania, Romania, and particularly China condemned the attack, and many other communist parties either lost influence, denounced the USSR, or split up/dissolved due to conflicting opinions. The invasion started a series of events that would ultimately see Brezhnev establishing peace with U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1972 after the latter's historic visit to China earlier that year.
The legacy of the invasion of Czechoslovakia remains widely talked about among historians, and has been seen as an important moment in the Cold War. Analysts believe that because of the invasion the worldwide communist movement became fractured and ultimately led to the Revolutions of 1989, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.","{2051, 515, 7, 2568, 524, 28, 4642, 4134, 1584, 4661, 2104, 1081, 2119, 2122, 4682, 595, 1622, 2141, 2152, 3692, 1649, 2169, 640, 4235, 2191, 144, 2703, 3727, 1177, 4768, 3752, 174, 4785, 717, 4815, 1746, 3795, 4307, 4829, 3322, 257, 3842, 4871, 2322, 3348, 278, 283, 4895, 290, 3874, 4905, 2875, 4413, 4430, 2388, 1370, 4445, 352, 4971, 889, 3451, 4993, 4994, 1931, 2955, 3979, 3989, 2475, 4526, 2483, 4020, 4024, 1979, 4539, 1985, 452, 964, 3524, 967, 4549, 2507, 2004, 5077, 987, 4074, 4589, 2040, 1017, 3578, 4605}",90,"['Soviet', 'Warsaw Pact', 'Czechoslovakia', 'The Warsaw Pact', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Operation Danube', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Warsaw Pact', 'the Soviet Union', 'Poland', 'Bulgaria', 'East Germany', 'Hungary', 'August 1968', 'Warsaw', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Romania', 'Albania', 'East German', 'Moscow', 'Czechoslovak', ""Alexander Dubček's"", 'Prague Spring', 'the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia', 'the Soviet Union', 'this era', 'the Warsaw Pact', 'communist', 'Western', 'Albania', 'Romania', 'China', 'communist', 'USSR', 'Brezhnev', 'U.S.', 'Richard Nixon', '1972', 'China', 'earlier that year', 'Czechoslovakia', 'the Cold War', '1989', 'the Soviet Union', '1991']","['NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE']"

While there was some immediate backlash, organized opposition did not get underway until the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy broke out following World War I; several states passed laws banning the teaching of evolution while others debated them but did not pass them. The Scopes Trial was the result of a challenge to the law in Tennessee. Scopes lost his case, and further states passed laws banning the teaching of evolution.
In 1968, the US Supreme Court ruled on Epperson v. Arkansas, another challenge to these laws, and the court ruled that allowing the teaching of creation, while disallowing the teaching of evolution, advanced a religion, and therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the constitution. Creationists then starting lobbying to have laws passed that required teachers to Teach the Controversy, but this was also struck down by the Supreme Court in 1987 in Edwards v. Aguillard. Creationists then moved to frame the issue as one of intelligent design but this too was ruled against in a District Court in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005.
The issue has remained contentious, with various US states debating, passing, or voting down alternative approaches to creationism in science classrooms. There is no bar in US law to creationism being taught in civics, current affairs, philosophy, or comparative religion classes.","{2568, 521, 3083, 528, 3090, 1562, 2078, 1566, 1058, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 3630, 1584, 2104, 1081, 4671, 1090, 3139, 4688, 2649, 2652, 4192, 2152, 1133, 4718, 1136, 2170, 2171, 3195, 131, 3727, 144, 154, 4768, 2210, 2213, 1711, 4785, 3777, 717, 3795, 4307, 3804, 3805, 4829, 3303, 4330, 748, 2798, 1783, 1272, 771, 1795, 4871, 1292, 3869, 4895, 3365, 4905, 4400, 4913, 4916, 309, 311, 1341, 1857, 4941, 2388, 4437, 352, 1386, 4971, 4472, 4990, 4991, 4993, 4994, 3459, 3460, 2955, 3979, 401, 5010, 3490, 5059, 452, 964, 968, 5065, 5067, 2508, 1997, 4558, 463, 5077, 5079, 3544, 3034, 478, 1502, 3040, 492, 3564, 3578, 2555, 4605}",108,"['US Supreme Court', 'Epperson', 'Arkansas', 'Arkansas', 'American', 'Genesis', 'Darwin', 'Fundamentalist', 'World War I', 'The Scopes Trial', 'Tennessee', '1968', 'the US Supreme Court', 'Epperson', 'Arkansas', 'the Establishment Clause', 'the Supreme Court', '1987', 'Edwards', 'Aguillard', 'District Court', 'Kitzmiller', 'Dover Area School District', '2005', 'US', 'US']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE']"

were a pop music group formed in 1958. Their lineup consisted of brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb. The trio were especially successful as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and later as prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid-to-late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s. The Bee Gees wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists.
Born on the Isle of Man to English parents, the Gibb brothers lived in Chorlton, Manchester, England until the late 1950s. There, in 1955, they formed the skiffle/rock and roll group the Rattlesnakes. The family then moved to Redcliffe, in the Moreton Bay Region, Queensland, Australia, and then to Cribb Island.  After achieving their first chart success in Australia as the Bee Gees with ""Spicks and Specks"" (their 12th single), they returned to the UK in January 1967, when producer Robert Stigwood began promoting them to a worldwide audience.
The Bee Gees have sold over 220 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; the presenter of the award to ""Britain's first family of harmony"" was Brian Wilson, historical frontman of the Beach Boys, another ""family act"" featuring three harmonising brothers. The Bee Gees' Hall of Fame citation says, ""Only Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney have outsold the Bee Gees."". The Bee Gees are the third most successful band in Billboard charts history after The Beatles and The Supremes.Following Maurice's death in January 2003 at the age of 53, Barry and Robin retired the group's name after 45 years of activity. In 2009, Robin announced that he and Barry had agreed the Bee Gees would re-form and perform again. Robin died in May 2012, aged 62, after a prolonged struggle with cancer and other health problems, leaving Barry as the only surviving member of the group.","{4097, 2051, 4101, 2568, 20, 2589, 1573, 4134, 4647, 1576, 2096, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4683, 4174, 4688, 595, 2141, 607, 2155, 3180, 1646, 1136, 1653, 2169, 2170, 2682, 2171, 640, 131, 4235, 1678, 2703, 3727, 4758, 1177, 4768, 2210, 1739, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 4313, 3803, 3805, 3812, 3303, 744, 2798, 4859, 3842, 1808, 3862, 3869, 290, 807, 4916, 309, 311, 4920, 2875, 4413, 2891, 4430, 1888, 1890, 873, 1388, 3954, 1908, 4474, 3451, 892, 4990, 895, 3970, 387, 3460, 903, 3978, 1422, 3989, 1432, 4014, 2483, 2995, 4539, 4549, 967, 5065, 971, 2507, 5077, 3040, 4589, 5106, 5117}",101,"['US', 'The Ed Sullivan Show', 'To Love Somebody', '1958', 'Barry', 'Robin', 'Maurice Gibb', 'the late 1960s', 'early 1970s', 'the mid-to-late 1970s', 'Robin', 'Barry', '1980s', 'the Isle of Man', 'English', 'Gibb', 'Chorlton', 'Manchester', 'England', 'the late 1950s', '1955', 'Rattlesnakes', 'Redcliffe', 'the Moreton Bay Region', 'Queensland', 'Australia', 'Cribb Island', 'Australia', 'Spicks and Specks', 'UK', 'January 1967', 'Robert Stigwood', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame', '1997', 'Britain', 'Brian Wilson', 'the Beach Boys', ""The Bee Gees' Hall of Fame"", 'Elvis Presley', 'Beatles', 'Michael Jackson', 'Garth Brooks', 'Paul McCartney', 'Maurice', 'January 2003', 'the age of 53', 'Barry', 'Robin', '45 years', '2009', 'Robin', 'Barry', 'Robin', 'May 2012', '62', 'Barry']","['GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON']"

The screenplay was written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, and was inspired by Clarke's short story ""The Sentinel"" and other short stories by Clarke. A novelisation of the film released after the film's premiere was in part written concurrently with the screenplay. The film, which follows a voyage to Jupiter with the sentient computer HAL after the discovery of a featureless alien monolith affecting human evolution, deals with themes of existentialism, human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.
The film is noted for its scientifically accurate depiction of space flight, pioneering special effects, and ambiguous imagery. Sound and dialogue are used sparingly and often in place of traditional cinematic and narrative techniques. The soundtrack incorporates a number of pieces of classical music, among them Also sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss, ""The Blue Danube"" by Johann Strauss II, and works by Aram Khachaturian and György Ligeti.
The film received diverse critical responses ranging from those who saw it as darkly apocalyptic in tone to those who saw it as an optimistic reappraisal of the hopes of humanity. The film garnered a cult following and became the highest-grossing North American film of 1968. It was nominated for four Academy Awards; Kubrick won for his direction of the visual effects.
2001: A Space Odyssey is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. In 1991, it was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 2010, it was named the greatest film of all time by The Moving Arts Film Journal.","{1025, 4611, 2568, 1058, 4134, 1576, 1584, 2104, 1085, 4671, 4174, 1622, 2152, 623, 1649, 2169, 2171, 640, 4235, 2703, 3727, 4768, 2210, 677, 1711, 703, 3777, 1746, 3795, 4307, 748, 1272, 1795, 269, 3862, 4895, 1319, 4905, 4400, 1847, 4920, 826, 2875, 4413, 325, 2388, 4437, 4445, 352, 4971, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 3459, 2955, 401, 1938, 5010, 3989, 1432, 3994, 4006, 4007, 4024, 1979, 452, 964, 1990, 4549, 971, 2507, 2508, 4558, 463, 2004, 5077, 1502, 4589, 3578, 4605}",81,"['2001 A Space Odyssey', 'Stanley Kubrick', 'Keir Dullea', 'Gary Lockwood', 'the Uptown Theater', 'Washington', 'D.C.', '2001', '1968', 'Stanley Kubrick', 'Kubrick', 'Arthur C.

Franklin began her career as a child singing gospel at New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan, where her father C. L. Franklin was minister. At the age of 18, she embarked on a secular-music career as a recording artist for Columbia Records. While Franklin's career did not immediately flourish, she found acclaim and commercial success after signing with Atlantic Records in 1966. Hit songs such as ""Respect"", ""Chain of Fools"", ""Think"", ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"", ""I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)"", and ""I Say a Little Prayer"", propelled her past her musical peers. By the end of the 1960s, Aretha Franklin had come to be known as the ""Queen of Soul"".
Franklin continued to record acclaimed albums such as I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Lady Soul (1968), Spirit in the Dark (1970), Young, Gifted and Black (1972), Amazing Grace (1972), and Sparkle (1976) before experiencing problems with her record company. Franklin left Atlantic in 1979 and signed with Arista Records. She appeared in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers before releasing the successful albums Jump to It (1982), Who's Zoomin' Who? (1985), and Aretha (1986) on the Arista label.  In 1998, Franklin returned to the Top 40 with the Lauryn Hill-produced song ""A Rose Is Still a Rose""; later, she released an album of the same name which was certified gold. That same year, Franklin earned international acclaim for her performance of ""Nessun dorma"" at the Grammy Awards; she filled in at the last minute for Luciano Pavarotti, who canceled his appearance after the show had already begun. In a widely noted performance, she paid tribute to 2015 honoree Carole King by singing ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"" at the Kennedy Center Honors.
Franklin recorded 112 charted singles on Billboard, including 77 Hot 100 entries, 17 top-ten pop singles, 100 R&B entries, and 20 number-one R&B singles. Franklin's well-known hits include ""Rock Steady"", ""Call Me"", ""Ain't No Way"", ""Don't Play That Song (You Lied)"", ""Spanish Harlem"", ""Day Dreaming"", ""Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)"", ""Something He Can Feel"", ""Jump to It"", ""Freeway of Love"", ""Who's Zoomin' Who"", and ""I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)"" (a duet with George Michael). She won 18 Grammy Awards, including the first eight awards given for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance (1968–1975). Franklin is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide.Franklin received numerous honors throughout her career. She was awarded the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1987, she became the first female performer to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She also was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2012. In 2010, Rolling Stone magazine ranked her number one on its list of the ""100 Greatest Singers of All Time"" and number nine on its list of ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"".

He became known as Maharishi (meaning ""great seer"") and Yogi as an adult.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi became a disciple and assistant of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati,  the Shankaracharya (spiritual leader) of Jyotirmath in the Indian Himalayas. The Maharishi credits Brahmananda Saraswati with inspiring his teachings. In 1955, the Maharishi began to introduce his Transcendental Deep Meditation (later renamed Transcendental Meditation) to India and the world. His first global tour began in 1958. His devotees referred to him as His Holiness, and because he often laughed in TV interviews he was sometimes referred to as the ""giggling guru"".The Maharishi is reported to have trained more than 40,000 TM teachers, taught the Transcendental Meditation technique to ""more than five million people"" and founded thousands of teaching centres and hundreds of colleges, universities and schools, while TM websites report tens of thousands learned the TM-Sidhi programme. His initiatives include schools and universities with campuses in several countries including India, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. The Maharishi, his family and close associates created charitable organisations and for-profit businesses including health clinics, mail-order health supplements and organic farms. The reported value of the Maharishi's organization has ranged from the millions to billions of U.S. dollars and in 2008, the organization placed the value of their United States assets at about $300 million.In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Maharishi achieved fame as the guru to the Beatles, the Beach Boys and other celebrities. In the late 1970s, he started the TM-Sidhi programme that claimed to offer practitioners the ability to levitate and to create world peace. The Maharishi's Natural Law Party was founded in 1992, and ran campaigns in dozens of countries. He moved to near Vlodrop, the Netherlands, in the same year. In 2000, he created the Global Country of World Peace, a non-profit organization, and appointed its leaders. In 2008, the Maharishi announced his retirement from all administrative activities and went into silence until his death three weeks later.","{3842, 2051, 387, 3978, 523, 2702, 20, 2210, 4014, 2995, 311, 967, 4426, 2507, 4815, 595, 4307, 4824, 2141, 607, 608, 3686, 874, 3180, 2159, 625, 370}",27,"['Beatles George Harrison', 'John Lennon', 'India', 'Maharishi Mahesh Yogi', 'Mahesh Prasad Varma', '12 January 1918', '5 February 2008', 'Indian', 'the Transcendental Meditation', 'Maharishi', 'Yogi', 'Maharishi Mahesh Yogi', 'Swami Brahmananda Saraswati', 'Shankaracharya', 'Jyotirmath', 'the Indian Himalayas', 'Maharishi', 'Brahmananda Saraswati', '1955', 'Maharishi', 'Transcendental Deep Meditation', 'Transcendental Meditation', 'India', '1958', 'His Holiness', 'guru""', 'Maharishi', 'TM', 'the Transcendental Meditation', 'TM', 'TM', 'India', 'Canada', 'the United States', 'the United Kingdom', 'Switzerland', 'Maharishi', 'Maharishi', '2008', 'their United States', 'the late 1960s', 'early 1970s', 'Maharishi', 'Beatles', 'the Beach Boys', 'the late 1970s', 'TM-Sidhi', 'Maharishi', 'Natural Law Party', '1992', 'Vlodrop', 'Netherlands', 'the same year', '2000', 'the Global Country of World Peace', '2008', 'Maharishi', 'three weeks later']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE']"
79,1968,February,29,"Beatles' ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" wins Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the first rock LP to do so",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band,"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart and 15 weeks at number one on the Billboard Top LPs chart in the US. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture. It won four Grammy Awards in 1968, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honour.
In August 1966, the Beatles permanently retired from touring and began a three-month holiday. During a return flight to London in November, Paul McCartney had an idea for a song involving an Edwardian military band that formed the impetus of the Sgt. Pepper concept. Sessions began on 24 November at EMI Studios with two compositions inspired by the Beatles' youth, ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""Penny Lane"", but after pressure from EMI, the songs were released as a double A-side single and left off the album.
In February 1967, after recording the title track, McCartney suggested that the album represent a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band. This alter ego group further inspired the band to experiment artistically. During the recording sessions, there was no thought of reproducing the songs in concert, and the band were free to continue the technological experimentation marked by their previous album Revolver, this time without an absolute deadline for completion. With producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick, the group approached the studio as an instrument, colouring much of the recordings with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"" and ""A Day in the Life"". Recording was completed on 21 April 1967. The cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a tableau of celebrities and historical figures, was designed by the pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth.
Sgt. Pepper is regarded by musicologists as an early concept album that advanced the use of extended form in popular music while continuing the artistic maturation seen on the Beatles' preceding releases. An important work of British psychedelia, the album incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including vaudeville, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. It is described as one of the first art rock LPs, a progenitor to progressive rock, and the starting point of the album era. In 2003, the Library of Congress placed Sgt. Pepper in the National Recording Registry as ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Rolling Stone ranked it as the greatest album of all time. It is one of the best-selling albums of all time, with more than 32 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011, and remains the UK's best-selling studio album. Professor Kevin Dettmar, writing in The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature, described it as ""the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded"".","{807, 2122, 971, 3180, 1422, 3951, 2096, 4815, 5106, 2995, 4891, 5117}",12,"[""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", 'Grammy Award for Album of the Year', ""Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", 'English', 'Beatles', 'May 1967', 'the United Kingdom', 'June 1967', 'the United States', '27 weeks', 'UK', '15 weeks', 'US', 'Grammy Awards', '1968', 'Album', 'August 1966', 'Beatles', 'three-month', 'London', 'November', 'Paul McCartney', 'Edwardian', 'Sgt', '24 November', 'EMI Studios', 'Beatles', 'Strawberry Fields Forever', 'Penny Lane', 'EMI', 'February 1967', 'McCartney', 'Sgt', 'Revolver', 'George Martin', 'Geoff Emerick', 'Lucy', 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite', '21 April 1967', 'Beatles', 'Peter Blake', 'Jann Haworth', 'Beatles', 'British', 'Western', 'Indian', '2003', 'Congress', 'Sgt', 'the National Recording Registry', 'Rolling Stone', '2011', 'UK', 'Kevin Dettmar', 'The Oxford Encyclopedia', 'British']","['ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP']"

Produced by Paul Simon, Roy Halee and Art Garfunkel, the album was released on April 3, 1968, in the United States by Columbia Records. The duo had risen to fame two years prior with the albums Sounds of Silence and Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme and the soundtrack album for the 1967 film The Graduate.
Bookends is a concept album that explores a life journey from childhood to old age. Side one of the album marks successive stages in life, the theme serving as bookends to the life cycle. Side two largely consists of unused material for The Graduate soundtrack. Simon's lyrics concern youth, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality. Much of the material was crafted alongside producer John Simon (no relation), who joined the recording when Paul Simon suffered from writer's block. The album was recorded gradually over the period of a year, with production speeding up around the later months of 1967.
Initial sales for Bookends were substantial in the US, and the album produced the number-one single ""Mrs. Robinson"". The album sold well in the US and in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number one. Bookends was considered a breakthrough for the duo, placing them on the same level as artists such as the Beatles, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones at the forefront of the cultural movement in the 1960s. The album has continued to receive critical acclaim.","{4097, 4611, 2051, 4101, 7, 2568, 521, 524, 528, 4113, 3090, 1555, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1566, 1569, 36, 1573, 4134, 39, 1576, 2601, 4647, 3630, 2096, 563, 4661, 56, 1081, 2621, 4671, 2112, 1090, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4688, 595, 1622, 2649, 2652, 2141, 619, 620, 1133, 1646, 2155, 1136, 1649, 3180, 1653, 2169, 2682, 3195, 2170, 2171, 127, 640, 2176, 4736, 131, 4235, 1678, 2703, 656, 1168, 3727, 1177, 4768, 2210, 677, 2213, 3243, 3244, 1709, 174, 1711, 699, 3777, 1739, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 4313, 3803, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3812, 3813, 3303, 744, 748, 2798, 1783, 1272, 2297, 3322, 1275, 4859, 3842, 1795, 1295, 1808, 4879, 3348, 3862, 3869, 4895, 290, 3874, 294, 807, 1319, 2856, 4905, 815, 4400, 2355, 4916, 309, 311, 1847, 4920, 826, 2875, 4924, 4413, 3903, 332, 4940, 4430, 4941, 4942, 2388, 3413, 352, 1888, 1890, 870, 873, 1386, 4971, 1388, 3951, 889, 4474, 3451, 892, 4990, 4993, 3970, 387, 388, 3459, 3460, 4994, 2955, 3979, 401, 1938, 3989, 1432, 418, 4007, 1960, 5033, 5037, 4014, 4526, 2483, 2995, 4020, 4024, 4539, 1475, 452, 3524, 1990, 967, 4549, 5059, 5065, 971, 2507, 1997, 2508, 5067, 4051, 2004, 5077, 5079, 3544, 3034, 2525, 1502, 3040, 2018, 492, 4589, 5106, 5107, 2039, 2040, 3578, 4605}",210,"[""Simon & Garfunkel's"", 'The Graduate', 'Grammy for Record of the Year', 'American', 'Simon & Garfunkel', 'Paul Simon', 'Roy Halee', 'Art Garfunkel', 'April 3, 1968', 'the United States', 'Columbia Records', 'two years', 'Sounds of Silence and Parsley, Sage, Rosemary', 'Thyme', '1967', 'The Graduate.\r\n', 'Graduate', 'Simon', 'John Simon', 'Paul Simon', 'the period of a year', 'the later months of 1967', 'Bookends', 'US', 'Robinson', 'US', 'the United Kingdom', 'Beatles', 'Bob Dylan', 'the Rolling Stones', 'the 1960s']","['ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE']"

He achieved success at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and as a scriptwriter and performer on The Frost Report. In the late 1960s, he co-founded Monty Python, the comedy troupe responsible for the sketch show Monty Python's Flying Circus. Along with his Python co-stars Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Graham Chapman, Cleese starred in Monty Python films, which include Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Life of Brian (1979) and The Meaning of Life (1983).
In the mid-1970s, Cleese and his first wife, Connie Booth, co-wrote the sitcom Fawlty Towers, and he starred in it as Basil Fawlty. The series resulted in Cleese receiving the 1980 BAFTA for Best Entertainment Performance, and in 2000 the show topped the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll Basil was ranked second on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. Cleese co-starred with Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and former Python colleague Michael Palin in A Fish Called Wanda (1989) and Fierce Creatures (1997), both of which he also wrote; for A Fish Called Wanda, he was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He has also starred in Time Bandits (1981) and Rat Race (2001) and has appeared in many other films, including Silverado (1985), Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994), two James Bond films (as R and Q), two Harry Potter films (as Nearly Headless Nick), and the last three Shrek films.
Emerging from the Cambridge Footlights in the 1960s, Cleese specialises in satire, black comedy, sketch comedy and surreal humour.

He is known for playing a wide range of starring or supporting roles, including comedy, romance, and darkly comic portrayals of anti-heroes and villainous characters. In many of his films, he played the ""eternal outsider, the sardonic drifter"", someone who rebels against the social structure.His most known and celebrated films include the road drama Easy Rider (1969); the dramas Five Easy Pieces (1970) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975); the comedy-dramas Carnal Knowledge (1971),  The Last Detail (1973), Terms of Endearment (1983), Prizzi's Honor (1985), As Good as It Gets (1997), and About Schmidt (2002); the neo-noir mystery Chinatown (1974); the horror film The Shining (1980); the biopic Reds (1981); the fantasy comedy The Witches of Eastwick (1987); the superhero film Batman (1989); the legal drama A Few Good Men (1992); the romantic horror film Wolf (1994); the science fiction comedy Mars Attacks! (1996); the comedy Anger Management (2003); the romantic comedy Something's Gotta Give (2003); and the crime drama The Departed (2006). He has also directed three films, including The Two Jakes (1990), the sequel to Chinatown.
Nicholson's 12 Academy Award nominations make him the most nominated male actor in the Academy's history. He has won the Academy Award for Best Actor twice: one for the drama One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and the other for the romantic comedy As Good as It Gets (1997). He also won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the comedy-drama Terms of Endearment (1983). He is one of only three male actors to win three Academy Awards, and is the only actor to be nominated for an Academy Award for acting in every decade from the 1960s to the 2000s. He has won six Golden Globe Awards and received the Kennedy Center Honor in 2001. In 1994, at 57, he became one of the youngest actors to be awarded the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award.

During the Mandatory period, numerous plans of partition of Palestine were proposed but without the agreement of all parties. In 1947, the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was voted. This triggered the 1947–1949 Palestine war and led, in 1948, to the establishment of the state of Israel on a part of Mandate Palestine as the Mandate came to an end. Since then there have been proposals to establish a Palestinian state. In 1969, for example, the PLO proposed the establishment of a binational state over the whole of the former British Mandate territory. This proposal was rejected by Israel, as it would have amounted to the disbanding of the state of Israel. The basis of the current proposals is for a two-state solution on either a portion of or the entirety of the Palestinian territories—the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which have been occupied by Israel since 1967.","{3842, 2322, 4768, 4134, 2096, 561, 4539, 4549, 967, 2122, 971, 2507, 4682, 4430, 4815, 595, 467, 3795, 4307, 2391, 3834, 3180, 4589, 625, 3190, 4474, 5117}",27,"['The Palestine National Congress', 'Yasser Arafat', 'PLO', 'the State of Palestine', 'the State of Palestine', 'the West Bank', 'Gaza Strip', 'Palestine', '1947', 'the United Nations Partition Plan', 'Palestine', 'Palestine', '1948', 'Israel', 'Mandate Palestine', 'Mandate', 'Palestinian', '1969', 'PLO', 'British', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Palestinian', 'the Gaza Strip', 'the West Bank', 'East Jerusalem', 'Israel', '1967']","['ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE']"
92,1969,February,5,US population reaches 200 million,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States,"The United States is the third-most populous country in the world, with an estimated population of 329,227,746 as of January 28, 2020. The United States Census Bureau shows a population increase of 0.75% for the twelve-month period ending in July 2012. Though high by industrialized country standards, this is below the world average annual rate of 1.1%. The total fertility rate in the United States estimated for 2018 is 1.73 children per woman, which is below the replacement fertility rate of approximately 2.1.
The American population almost quadrupled during the 20th century—at a growth rate of about 1.3% a year—from about 76 million in 1900 to 281 million in 2000. It is estimated to have reached the 200 million mark in 1967, and the 300 million mark on October 17, 2006. Population growth is fastest among minorities as a whole, and according to the Census Bureau's estimation for 2012, 50.4% of American children under the age of 1 belonged to racial and ethnic minority groups.White people constitute the majority of the U.S. population, with a total of about 234,370,202 or 73% of the population as of 2017. Non-Hispanic Whites make up 60.7% of the country's population, though some Latin Americans consider themselves to be fully white on the Census. When this is taken into account, white Americans with no Latin American ancestry make up 52.7% of the population. The non-Hispanic white population of the U.S. is expected to fall below 50% by 2045, primarily due to immigration and low birth rates.Hispanic and Latino Americans accounted for 48% of the national population growth of 2.9 million between July 1, 2005, and July 1, 2006. Immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants are expected to provide most of the U.S. population gains in the decades ahead.The Census Bureau projects a U.S. population of 417 million in 2060, a 38% increase from 2007 (301.3 million), and the United Nations estimates the U.S. population will be 402 million in 2050, an increase of 32% from 2007. In an official census report, it was reported that 54.4% (2,150,926 out of 3,953,593) of births in 2010 were non-Hispanic white. This represents an increase of 0.3% compared to the previous year, which was 54.1%.","{4611, 2568, 521, 3083, 528, 4113, 3090, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1566, 1058, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 3630, 1584, 4661, 2104, 1081, 2621, 4671, 3139, 2628, 4688, 1622, 2649, 3163, 2652, 2141, 4192, 2152, 2155, 1133, 1649, 2169, 3195, 2171, 640, 2176, 131, 4235, 2703, 144, 3727, 1177, 154, 4768, 2213, 4775, 3243, 684, 1709, 1711, 703, 2241, 3777, 4807, 717, 3277, 3795, 4307, 3285, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3303, 4330, 748, 2798, 1783, 1272, 2297, 1275, 771, 1795, 1292, 3869, 4895, 290, 2342, 294, 1319, 4905, 3882, 1323, 4400, 311, 826, 2875, 1341, 4413, 3903, 1857, 4941, 4942, 3413, 4437, 1888, 355, 1386, 4971, 4472, 4986, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 3459, 3460, 1929, 2955, 3979, 401, 5010, 1432, 4007, 5033, 4014, 4526, 2483, 1979, 5059, 452, 964, 3524, 4549, 2507, 2508, 1997, 4558, 5067, 2004, 5077, 5079, 3544, 3034, 478, 1502, 3040, 492, 5107, 2040, 3578, 4605}",146,"['US', 'The United States', 'January 28, 2020', 'The United States Census Bureau', '0.75%', 'twelve-month', 'July 2012', 'annual', '1.1%', 'the United States', '2018', 'American', 'the 20th century', 'about 1.3%', '1900', '2000', '1967', 'October 17, 2006', ""the Census Bureau's"", '2012', '50.4%', 'American', 'the age of 1', 'U.S.', '73%', '2017', 'Non-Hispanic', '60.7%', 'Latin Americans', 'Americans', 'Latin American', '52.7%', 'non-Hispanic', 'U.S.', 'below 50%', '2045', 'Hispanic', 'Latino Americans', '48%', 'between July 1, 2005', 'July 1, 2006', 'U.S.', 'the decades ahead', 'The Census Bureau', 'U.S.', '2060', '38%', '2007', 'the United Nations', 'U.S.', '2050', '32%', '2007', '54.4%', '2010', 'non-Hispanic', '0.3%', 'the previous year', '54.1%']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERCENT', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERCENT', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'PERCENT']"

In 2013, women accounted for 8% of all national leaders and 2% of all presidential posts. Furthermore, 75% of all female prime ministers and presidents have taken office in the past two decades.Women may face a number of challenges that affect their ability to participate in political life and become political leaders. A number of countries are exploring measures that may increase women's participation in government at all levels, from the local to the national.

95,1969,July,20,Apollo 11 lunar module carrying Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin lands on the surface of the Moon; Aldrin and Armstrong walk on the moon seven hours later; Michael Collins remains in orbit in the lunar module,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong,"Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut and aeronautical engineer and the first person to walk on the Moon. He was also a naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor.
A graduate of Purdue University, Armstrong studied aeronautical engineering; his college tuition was paid for by the U.S. Navy under the Holloway Plan. He became a midshipman in 1949 and a naval aviator the following year. He saw action in the Korean War, flying the Grumman F9F Panther from the aircraft carrier USS Essex. In September 1951, while making a low bombing run, Armstrong's aircraft was damaged when it collided with an anti-aircraft cable which cut off a large portion of one wing. Armstrong was forced to bail out. After the war, he completed his bachelor's degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base in California. He was the project pilot on Century Series fighters and flew the North American X-15 seven times. He was also a participant in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs.
Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group, which was selected in 1962. He made his first spaceflight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. During this mission with pilot David Scott, he performed the first docking of two spacecraft; the mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his re-entry control fuel to stabilize a dangerous roll caused by a stuck thruster. During training for Armstrong's second and last spaceflight as commander of Apollo 11, he had to eject from the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle moments before a crash.
On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Apollo 11 Lunar Module (LM) pilot Buzz Aldrin became the first people to land on the Moon, and the next day they spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the mission's command module (CM). When Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: ""That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."" Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong with the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, and Armstrong and his former crewmates received a Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.
After he resigned from NASA in 1971, Armstrong taught in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati until 1979. He served on the Apollo 13 accident investigation and on the Rogers Commission, which investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. He acted as a spokesman for several businesses and appeared in advertising for the automotive brand Chrysler starting in January 1979.","{4611, 2051, 1541, 7, 2568, 524, 2063, 528, 4115, 2076, 2589, 1566, 1058, 4134, 1576, 4649, 2092, 4140, 1583, 1584, 3119, 565, 4661, 2104, 4157, 4671, 576, 4675, 580, 75, 3154, 1622, 2647, 3676, 2141, 609, 1633, 4193, 612, 2152, 1133, 1137, 1649, 3702, 2169, 2171, 640, 1153, 4736, 1162, 4235, 653, 2703, 144, 3727, 663, 152, 1177, 4768, 2210, 2722, 1703, 1192, 4775, 3243, 1709, 173, 1711, 174, 176, 177, 4785, 182, 703, 4287, 3777, 3781, 1222, 1742, 1746, 3795, 4307, 4829, 1251, 2793, 748, 1272, 2296, 3322, 3842, 771, 1795, 264, 1288, 4895, 3874, 2342, 1319, 2856, 4905, 3882, 3885, 4400, 4915, 1847, 826, 2875, 3901, 4413, 839, 843, 2901, 3413, 2391, 4437, 1374, 1888, 4967, 874, 4971, 2415, 889, 890, 1403, 3451, 4986, 4990, 4992, 4993, 4994, 3459, 900, 2948, 4998, 903, 1929, 3978, 2955, 3468, 3979, 4492, 1938, 5010, 3989, 1432, 5022, 418, 4516, 423, 424, 4007, 5033, 430, 1455, 4526, 2483, 4020, 2487, 1979, 5052, 452, 964, 3524, 4549, 968, 2507, 2508, 4558, 463, 1999, 2004, 5077, 471, 4056, 2525, 1502, 1508, 2026, 494, 1526, 2040, 3578, 5115, 4605}",184,"['Neil Armstrong', 'Buzz Aldrin', 'Moon', 'Aldrin', 'Armstrong', 'Michael Collins', 'Neil Alden Armstrong', 'August 5, 1930', 'August 25, 2012', 'American', 'Moon', 'Purdue University', 'Armstrong', 'the U.S. Navy', 'the Holloway Plan', '1949', 'the following year', 'the Korean War', 'USS Essex', 'September 1951', 'Armstrong', 'Armstrong', 'Purdue', 'the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics', 'NACA', 'Edwards Air Force Base', 'California', 'Century Series', 'North American', ""the U.S. Air Force's"", 'Dyna-Soar', 'Armstrong', 'the NASA Astronaut Corps', '1962', 'Gemini 8', 'March 1966', 'NASA', 'David Scott', 'Armstrong', 'Armstrong', 'Apollo', 'the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle', 'July 20, 1969', 'Armstrong', 'Apollo', '11 Lunar Module', 'Buzz Aldrin', 'Moon', 'the next day', 'two and a half hours', 'Michael Collins', 'CM', 'Armstrong', 'Collins', 'Aldrin', 'Armstrong', 'the Presidential Medal of Freedom', 'Richard Nixon', 'Jimmy Carter', 'Armstrong', '1978', 'Armstrong', '2009', 'NASA', '1971', 'Armstrong', 'the Department of Aerospace Engineering', 'the University of Cincinnati', '1979', 'Apollo', 'the Rogers Commission', 'Chrysler', 'January 1979']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERCENT', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE']"

98,1969,September,1,Colonel Muammar Gaddafi deposes King Idris in the Libyan revolution,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi,"Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi (c. 1942 – 20 October 2011), commonly known as Colonel Gaddafi, was a Libyan revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977, and then as the ""Brother Leader"" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism but later ruled according to his own Third International Theory.
Born near Sirte, Italian Libya, to a poor Bedouin family, Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. Within the military, he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the Western-backed Senussi monarchy of Idris in a 1969 coup. Having taken power, Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic governed by his Revolutionary Command Council. Ruling by decree, he deported Libya's Italian and Jewish populations and ejected its Western military bases. Strengthening ties to Arab nationalist governments—particularly Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt—he unsuccessfully advocated pan-Arab political union. An Islamic modernist, he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and promoted ""Islamic socialism"". He nationalized the oil industry and used the increasing state revenues to bolster the military, fund foreign revolutionaries, and implement social programs emphasizing house-building, healthcare and education projects. In 1973, he initiated a ""Popular Revolution"" with the formation of Basic People's Congresses, presented as a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year in The Green Book.
Gaddafi transformed Libya into a new socialist state called a Jamahiriya (""state of the masses"") in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both the military and the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya's unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing in Scotland left it increasingly isolated on the world stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, resulting in the 1986 US bombing of Libya and United Nations–imposed economic sanctions. From 1999, Gaddafi shunned Arab socialism and encouraged economic privatization, rapprochement with Western nations, and pan-Africanism; he was Chairperson of the African Union from 2009 to 2010. Amid the 2011 Arab Spring, protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into civil war, in which NATO intervened militarily on the side of the anti-Gaddafist National Transitional Council (NTC). The government was overthrown, and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be captured and killed by NTC militants.
A highly divisive figure, Gaddafi dominated Libya's politics for four decades and was the subject of a pervasive cult of personality. He was decorated with various awards and praised for his anti-imperialist stance, support for Arab—and then African—unity, and for significant improvements that his government brought to the Libyan people's quality of life. Conversely, many Libyans strongly opposed his social and economic reforms, and he was posthumously accused of sexual abuse. He was condemned by many as a dictator whose authoritarian administration violated human rights and financed global terrorism.","{1026, 2051, 2052, 4101, 7, 2568, 521, 3081, 524, 528, 4113, 3090, 1557, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1566, 1058, 4134, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4647, 3630, 1584, 561, 563, 4661, 2104, 1081, 4671, 3139, 2628, 2119, 586, 4682, 4688, 595, 1622, 2649, 3163, 2652, 2141, 4192, 2152, 619, 2155, 3693, 1136, 1649, 2169, 2682, 2171, 3195, 2170, 635, 2684, 640, 2176, 4736, 131, 2184, 4235, 2191, 144, 2703, 3727, 1177, 154, 4768, 2210, 2213, 3243, 1709, 174, 703, 3777, 1222, 1228, 717, 2764, 3277, 2771, 3795, 3285, 4307, 4313, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3303, 4330, 2798, 1783, 1272, 3322, 1275, 257, 3842, 771, 4871, 1292, 4879, 1808, 278, 3869, 4895, 290, 3874, 3365, 294, 1319, 4905, 815, 4916, 309, 311, 4920, 2875, 1341, 4413, 3903, 1857, 4940, 4941, 4430, 4942, 2388, 3413, 4445, 355, 1386, 4971, 3951, 4472, 889, 1403, 3451, 4990, 4993, 3970, 4994, 3460, 2955, 3979, 401, 1938, 3989, 1432, 5019, 1960, 2475, 4014, 4526, 2483, 4020, 4024, 1979, 4539, 5059, 452, 964, 3524, 4549, 5065, 971, 2508, 1997, 5067, 463, 4563, 2004, 5077, 5079, 3544, 3034, 2525, 478, 1502, 3040, 492, 4589, 5107, 2040, 3578, 4605}",187,"['Muammar Gaddafi', 'King Idris', 'Libyan', 'Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi', '1942', 'Gaddafi', 'Libyan', 'Libya', 'the Libyan Arab Republic', '1969 to 1977', ""the Great Socialist People's"", '1977 to 2011', 'Arab', 'Arab', 'Sirte', 'Italian', 'Libya', 'Bedouin', 'Gaddafi', 'Arab', 'Sabha', 'the Royal Military Academy', 'Benghazi', 'Western', 'Senussi', 'Idris', '1969', 'Gaddafi', 'Libya', 'Revolutionary Command Council', 'Libya', 'Italian', 'Jewish', 'Western', 'Arab', ""Gamal Abdel Nasser's"", 'Egypt', 'pan-Arab', 'Islamic', 'Islamic', '1973', 'a ""Popular Revolution', ""Basic People's Congresses"", 'that year', 'The Green Book', 'Gaddafi', 'Libya', '1977', 'the Revolutionary Committees', '1970s', '1980s', 'Libya', 'Egypt', 'Chad', 'Lockerbie', 'Scotland', 'the United States', 'United Kingdom', 'Israel', '1986', 'US', 'Libya', 'United Nations', '1999', 'Gaddafi', 'Arab', 'Western', 'pan-Africanism', 'Chairperson', 'the African Union', '2009 to 2010', '2011', 'Arab Spring', 'Libya', 'NATO', 'National Transitional Council', 'Gaddafi', 'Sirte', 'Gaddafi', 'Libya', 'four decades', 'Arab', 'African', 'Libyan', 'Libyans']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP']"

This movement informed and helped shape the vigorous and polarizing debate, primarily in the United States, during the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s on how to end the war.
Many in the peace movement within the United States were students, mothers, or anti-establishment hippies. Opposition grew with participation by the African-American civil rights, women's liberation, Chicano Movements, and sectors of organized labor. Additional involvement came from many other groups, including educators, clergy, academics, journalists, lawyers, physicians—such as Benjamin Spock—and military veterans.
Their actions consisted mainly of peaceful, nonviolent events; few events were deliberately provocative and violent. In some cases, police used violent tactics against peaceful demonstrators. By 1967, according to Gallup polls, an increasing majority of Americans considered military involvement in Vietnam to be a mistake, echoed decades later by the then-head of American war planning, former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.","{1272, 3459, 1795, 2052, 7, 2568, 2955, 3979, 5010, 1319, 1576, 3243, 1709, 4526, 1711, 563, 4661, 1979, 4671, 2112, 580, 3524, 586, 2379, 3322, 1997, 4558, 2004, 3413, 4437, 3034, 3813, 4971, 748, 632, 889, 3578, 3195, 4605, 127}",40,"['the Vietnam War Moratorium Demonstration', 'the United States', 'United States', 'the Vietnam War', '1964', 'the United States', 'the Vietnam War', 'several years', 'the United States', 'the second half of the 1960s', 'early 1970s', 'the United States', 'African-American', 'Chicano Movements', 'Benjamin Spock', '1967', 'Gallup', 'Americans', 'Vietnam', 'American', 'Defense', 'Robert McNamara']","['EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON']"
101,1969,November,19,Apollo 12's Charles Conrad and Alan Bean become the 3rd and 4th humans on the Moon,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program,"The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the third United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which succeeded in landing the first humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. First conceived during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person Project Mercury, which put the first Americans in space. Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy's national goal of ""landing a man on the Moon by the end of this decade and returning him safely to the Earth"" in an address to Congress on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person Project Gemini conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.
Kennedy's goal was accomplished on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Apollo Lunar Module (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last, Apollo 17, in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon.

Apollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed flight in 1968. It encountered a major setback in 1967 when an Apollo 1 cabin fire killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first successful landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the Apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which destroyed the service module's capability to provide electrical power, crippling the CSM's propulsion and life support systems. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the lunar module as a ""lifeboat"" for these functions. Apollo used Saturn family rockets as launch vehicles, which were also used for an Apollo Applications Program, which consisted of Skylab, a space station that supported three crewed missions in 1973–74, and the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, a joint US-Soviet Union Earth-orbit mission in 1975.
Apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones. It stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit. Apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, and Apollo 11 was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one.
Overall the Apollo program returned 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center.

The Institute is a land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant university, with an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River. The Institute also encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. It has since played a key role in the development of many aspects of modern science, engineering, mathematics, and technology, and is widely known for its innovation and academic strength, making it one of the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in the world.As of October 2019, 96 Nobel laureates, 26 Turing Award winners, and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT as alumni, faculty members, or researchers. In addition, 58 National Medal of Science recipients, 29 National Medals of Technology and Innovation recipients, 50 MacArthur Fellows, 73 Marshall Scholars, 48 Rhodes Scholars, 41 astronauts, and 16 Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force have been affiliated with MIT.

103,1969,December,5,Four-node ARPANET network is established,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET,"The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first wide-area packet-switching network with distributed control and the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. The ARPANET was established by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.Building on the ideas of J. C. R. Licklider, Bob Taylor initiated the ARPANET project in 1966 and appointed Larry Roberts as program manager. Roberts made the key decisions about the network design. He incorporated Donald Davies’ concepts and designs for packet switching, and sought input from Paul Baran. ARPA awarded the contract to build the network to Bolt Beranek & Newman who developed the first protocol for the network. Roberts engaged Leonard Kleinrock to develop mathematical methods for analyzing the packet network technology.The first computers were connected in 1969 and the Network Control Program was implemented in 1970. The network expanded rapidly and was declared operational in 1975 when control passed to the Defense Communications Agency.
Internetworking research in the early 1970s by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf led to the formulation of the Transmission Control Program (TCP) in 1974, which incorporated concepts from the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin. As this work progressed, a protocol was developed by which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks. Originally referred to as IP/TCP, version 4 of TCP/IP was installed in the ARPANET for production use in January 1983 after the Department of Defense made it standard for all military computer networking.Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981, when the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the Computer Science Network (CSNET). In the early 1980s, the NSF funded the establishment of national supercomputing centers at several universities, and provided network access and network interconnectivity with the NSFNET project in 1986. The ARPANET project was formally decommissioned in 1990, after partnerships with the telecommunication and computer industry paved the way for future commercialization of a new world-wide network, known as the Internet.","{3842, 7, 2955, 1275, 1170, 3989, 5019, 2169, 3874, 2475, 174, 563, 1204, 4020, 310, 4024, 66, 580, 1222, 586, 3322, 463, 3927, 1502, 3427, 4589, 889, 3578, 3451, 4605}",30,"['ARPANET', 'The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network', 'ARPANET', 'TCP', 'ARPANET', 'the Advanced Research Projects Agency', 'the United States Department of Defense', 'J.

It was also directed by Jones. The film tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Chapman), a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as—and next door to—Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.
Following the withdrawal of funding by EMI Films just days before production was scheduled to begin, long-time Monty Python fan and former member of the Beatles, George Harrison, arranged financing for Life of Brian through the formation of his company HandMade Films.The film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release, drawing accusations of blasphemy, and protests from some religious groups. Thirty-nine local authorities in the United Kingdom either imposed an outright ban, or imposed an X (18 years) certificate, effectively preventing the film from being shown, since the distributors said it could not be shown unless it was unedited and carried the original AA (14) certificate. Some countries, including Ireland and Norway, banned its showing, with a few of these bans lasting decades. The filmmakers used such notoriety to benefit their marketing campaign, with posters in Sweden reading, ""So funny, it was banned in Norway!""The film was a box office success, the fourth-highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom in 1979, and highest grossing of any British film in the United States that year. It has remained popular, receiving positive reviews. The film was named ""greatest comedy film of all time"" by several magazines and television networks, and it later received a 95% ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus, ""One of the more cutting-edge films of the 1970s, this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical."" In a 2006 Channel 4 poll, Life of Brian was ranked first on their list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films.","{2051, 7, 2568, 521, 33, 1058, 4134, 4647, 1576, 2601, 1583, 561, 563, 2104, 586, 4682, 4688, 1622, 2647, 2141, 3581, 620, 1646, 1649, 2169, 2170, 2682, 127, 640, 1153, 1162, 3722, 1678, 2703, 1168, 3727, 1177, 4768, 680, 1192, 176, 1732, 3272, 1739, 2764, 3277, 4307, 3803, 3812, 3813, 2278, 234, 4330, 3322, 3842, 4879, 4895, 290, 815, 310, 3903, 843, 4940, 4430, 2388, 2901, 4445, 1888, 1890, 4967, 873, 1388, 2415, 4472, 889, 3451, 4993, 4994, 387, 900, 3978, 2955, 3979, 3989, 5019, 418, 2483, 4024, 4539, 452, 3524, 4549, 2507, 2508, 4051, 4563, 5077, 1508, 4589, 4605}",100,"['British', 'Monty Python', 'Graham Chapman', 'John Cleese', 'Terry Gilliam', 'Eric Idle', 'Terry Jones', 'Michael Palin', 'Life of Brian', 'Life of Brian', '1979', 'British', 'Monty Python', 'Graham Chapman', 'John Cleese', 'Terry Gilliam', 'Eric Idle', 'Terry Jones', 'Michael Palin', 'Jones', 'Brian Cohen', 'Chapman', 'Jewish', 'Jesus Christ', 'EMI Films', 'just days', 'Monty Python', 'Beatles', 'George Harrison', 'Life of Brian', 'HandMade Films', 'the United Kingdom', '18 years', 'Ireland', 'Norway', 'decades', 'Sweden', 'the United Kingdom', '1979', 'British', 'the United States', '95%', 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'the 1970s', '2006', 'Channel 4', 'Life of Brian', 'Greatest Comedy Films']","['NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERCENT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'EVENT']"

The plot concerns an aging outlaw gang on the Mexico–United States border trying to adapt to the changing modern world of 1913. The film was controversial because of its graphic violence and its portrayal of crude men attempting to survive by any available means.The screenplay was co-written by Peckinpah, Walon Green, and Roy N. Sickner. The Wild Bunch was filmed in Technicolor and Panavision, in Mexico, notably at the Hacienda Ciénaga del Carmen, deep in the desert between Torreón and Saltillo, Coahuila, and on the Rio Nazas. 
The Wild Bunch is noted for intricate, multi-angle, quick-cut editing using normal and slow motion images, a revolutionary cinema technique in 1969. The writing of Green, Peckinpah, and Roy N. Sickner was nominated for a best screenplay Oscar, and the music by Jerry Fielding was nominated for Best Original Score. Additionally, Peckinpah was nominated for an Outstanding Directorial Achievement award by the Directors Guild of America, and cinematographer Lucien Ballard won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Cinematography.
In 1999, the U.S. National Film Registry selected The Wild Bunch for preservation in the Library of Congress as “culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant”. The film was ranked 80th in the American Film Institute's 100 best American films and the 69th most thrilling film.

108,1969,January,12,Debut album of Led Zeppelin released first in the US,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin_discography,"The discography of the English rock band Led Zeppelin consists of eight studio albums, four live albums, nine compilation albums, sixteen singles and eight music downloads. Formed in London in 1968, the group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band pioneered the concept of album-oriented rock and often refused to release popular songs as singles.  Their debut album, Led Zeppelin (1969), released by Atlantic Records, charted at number six on the UK Albums Chart and at number ten on the United States Billboard 200. It received several sales certifications, including an 8 times multi-platinum from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Diamond from the Music Canada. Led Zeppelin's second studio album, Led Zeppelin II, recorded when the band were on tour, was released a few months after the first. It reached number one in several countries, including the UK and the US, where it was certified 12 times multi-platinum. The album produced Led Zeppelin's most successful single, ""Whole Lotta Love"", which peaked at several music charts in the top 10. Led Zeppelin III (1970) was a softer, more folk-based effort compared to the hard rock of the band's previous releases. It also peaked at number one in the UK and in the US.
Led Zeppelin's untitled fourth album, often called Led Zeppelin IV and released on 8 November 1971, is their most commercially successful album. It received a 23 times multi-platinum certification from RIAA, the third-highest of all albums. The band's fifth album, Houses of the Holy, was released in 1973. Again a transatlantic chart-topper, it has received an 11 times multi-platinum certification from RIAA. In 1974, the band set up their own vanity label, Swan Song Records, which would release the rest of Led Zeppelin's studio albums. The first was the 1975 double album Physical Graffiti, which has received a 16 times platinum certification from RIAA. However, Zeppelin's seventh album, Presence (1976), did not perform as well as their previous releases, receiving a triple Platinum certification from RIAA. On 20 October 1976 Led Zeppelin released their first concert film The Song Remains the Same. The recording of the film took place during three nights of concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City, during the band's 1973 concert tour of the United States. The band's eighth album, In Through the Out Door, received a sextuple platinum certification. This was the last album released by the band before Bonham died of alcohol intoxication in 1980; Led Zeppelin disbanded immediately afterwards.In 1982 Led Zeppelin released the album Coda, a compilation of outtakes from the band's previous recordings. Since their break-up, the band have released numerous compilation and live albums from older concerts, including How the West Was Won, which peaked at number one on the Billboard charts, and the compilation album Mothership, which produced seven music downloads and was released on the same day Led Zeppelin's entire catalog became available in digital stores, including in the iTunes Store.

110,1969,July,11,"David Bowie releases the single ""Space Oddity"" 9 days before Apollo 11 lands on the moon",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie_discography,"The discography of English singer-songwriter David Bowie (1947–2016) included 27 studio albums (including nine UK number-one albums), 11 live albums, 51 compilation albums (including  two  UK  number-one albums), nine extended plays (EPs), 128 singles (including five UK number-one singles), and four soundtracks. Bowie also released 14 video albums and 72 music videos.
Bowie's debut release was the 1964 single ""Liza Jane"" by Davie Jones & the King Bees. He released two more singles in 1965 under the names of The Manish Boys and Davy Jones & the Lower Third. His first release using the name David Bowie was the 1966 single ""Can't Help Thinking About Me"", which was released with The Lower Third. Bowie's next single, ""Do Anything You Say"", also released in 1966, was the first release by simply David Bowie. Bowie released four more singles and his debut album, David Bowie, but the first success in the United Kingdom was with the 1969 single ""Space Oddity"". The single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart after it was released five days before the Apollo 11 moon mission.Bowie released three more albums – David Bowie (1969), The Man Who Sold the World (1970) and Hunky Dory (1971) – before he eventually made it on to the UK Albums Chart with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), which peaked at number five. Following the success of Ziggy Stardust, sales of Hunky Dory improved and it eventually peaked at number three in the UK. RCA re-released the 1969 David Bowie  under the title Space Oddity (with an updated Ziggy Stardust-era photo) and The Man Who Sold the World, which reached numbers 17 and 26 in the UK respectively (but the last one reached number 21 after the Bowie'death in 2016).
Bowie released nine more studio albums with RCA, all of which reached the top five of the UK Albums Chart, of which Aladdin Sane (1973), Pin Ups (1973), Diamond Dogs (1974) and Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) (1980) reached the number one position. His 1975 RCA album ""Young Americans"" included his first #1 US single ""Fame"", which was co-written by John Lennon — who also performed on the album — and Carlos Alomar. He then released three solo studio albums with EMI – Let's Dance (1983), whose title track became his first single to reach number one in both the United Kingdom and the United States, Tonight (1984) and Never Let Me Down (1987). Let's Dance and Tonight reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, while Never Let Me Down reached number six. The success of Let's Dance revitalized Bowie's back catalogue: throughout the summer of 1983, he had multiple albums on the UK Albums Chart. This peaked on 16 July that year, with ten entries – a figure bettered only by Elvis Presley.In 1989, Bowie created the rock group Tin Machine, who released a self-titled album with EMI. Although Tin Machine reached number three on the UK Albums Chart, it did not sell well and Bowie and EMI did not renew their contract. Tin Machine II followed in 1991 on London Records and, only reaching number 23 in the UK, was Bowie's worst-charting album since the 1973 re-release of The Man Who Sold the World. Continuing as a solo artist, Bowie's next album, Black Tie White Noise (1993), reached the number one position on the UK Albums Chart. Bowie released a further seven studio albums, all of which have reached the top ten in the UK. Released after a ten-year hiatus, The Next Day (2013) was Bowie's first UK chart-topping album since Black Tie White Noise (1993). Bowie released his final album, Blackstar on 8 January 2016, his 69th birthday and two days before his death on 10 January. The album debuted at number one in the UK and became Bowie's first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 in the US.","{521, 1546, 3083, 528, 3601, 3090, 3091, 4113, 1562, 28, 2589, 2078, 1058, 3621, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4138, 3630, 1584, 563, 4661, 2102, 2104, 1081, 58, 1597, 576, 3139, 580, 4675, 75, 1619, 2647, 4695, 91, 2652, 3676, 4192, 1633, 4193, 2152, 4718, 632, 3195, 2171, 124, 2176, 131, 3210, 3722, 4235, 3727, 144, 1168, 1170, 661, 663, 152, 154, 155, 666, 2722, 1192, 3243, 3244, 1197, 174, 1709, 1711, 4785, 177, 3252, 703, 4287, 2241, 3777, 1222, 4807, 3272, 2767, 1746, 4825, 4826, 3804, 1757, 4829, 1251, 3301, 3814, 3303, 2793, 4330, 748, 1783, 1785, 2297, 3322, 256, 771, 3332, 264, 1288, 1289, 268, 1292, 278, 3359, 4895, 3874, 805, 3365, 1319, 4905, 2346, 1323, 3882, 303, 304, 4400, 4913, 3381, 310, 311, 3382, 4407, 4923, 1341, 4413, 3903, 1857, 843, 2379, 4941, 2901, 3413, 3927, 4437, 858, 1373, 1374, 1386, 2924, 368, 1905, 3958, 4472, 4990, 4991, 4994, 3459, 900, 1929, 2955, 3979, 3980, 1424, 401, 3473, 5010, 2964, 4511, 1444, 4516, 2982, 424, 4526, 2487, 1464, 1977, 4536, 3005, 5054, 1471, 3008, 4545, 5059, 452, 964, 3524, 5067, 460, 1997, 2508, 463, 4558, 4561, 1491, 2004, 4563, 471, 5079, 3034, 2525, 478, 990, 1502, 3038, 996, 999, 3047, 2026, 3054, 3578, 4605, 511}",207,"['David Bowie', 'Space Oddity', '9 days', 'Apollo', 'English', 'David Bowie', 'UK', 'UK', 'UK', 'Bowie', 'Bowie', '1964', 'Liza Jane""', 'Davie Jones &', 'the King Bees', '1965', 'The Manish Boys and Davy Jones &', 'David Bowie', '1966', '""Can\'t Help Thinking About Me""', 'Bowie', 'Do Anything You Say', '1966', 'David Bowie', 'David Bowie', 'the United Kingdom', '1969', 'five days', 'Apollo', 'David Bowie', '1969', 'The Man Who Sold the World', '1970', 'Hunky Dory', '1971', 'UK', 'Ziggy Stardust', 'Mars', '1972', 'Ziggy Stardust', 'Hunky Dory', 'UK', '1969', 'Ziggy Stardust-era', 'The Man Who Sold the World', '17', 'UK', '2016', 'RCA', 'UK', 'Aladdin Sane', '1973', 'Pin Ups', '1973', 'Diamond Dogs', '1974', 'Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps', '1980', '1975', 'Young Americans', 'Fame', 'John Lennon', 'Carlos Alomar', 'EMI', '1983', 'the United Kingdom', 'the United States', '1984', 'Never Let Me Down', '1987', 'UK', 'Never Let Me Down', 'Bowie', 'the summer of 1983', 'UK', '16 July that year', 'Elvis Presley', '1989', 'Bowie', 'Tin Machine', 'EMI', 'Tin', 'UK', 'Bowie', 'EMI', 'Tin Machine II', '1991', 'London Records', 'UK', 'Bowie', '1973', 'The Man Who Sold the World', 'Bowie', 'Black Tie White Noise', '1993', 'the UK Albums Chart', 'Bowie', 'UK', 'ten-year', 'The Next Day', '2013', 'Bowie', 'UK', 'Black Tie White Noise', '1993', 'Blackstar', '8 January 2016', 'two days', '10 January', 'UK', 'Bowie', 'US']","['PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE']"

Billed as ""an Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace & Music"" and alternatively referred to as the Bethel Rock Festival, it attracted an audience of more than 400,000. Thirty-two acts performed outdoors despite sporadic rain.The festival has become widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history as well as a defining event for the counterculture generation. The event's significance was reinforced by a 1970 documentary film, an accompanying soundtrack album, and a song written by Joni Mitchell that became a major hit for both Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and Matthews Southern Comfort.  Music events bearing the Woodstock name have been planned for anniversaries including the tenth, twentieth, twenty-fifth, thirtieth, fortieth, and fiftieth. In 2004 Rolling Stone magazine listed it as number 19 of the 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll. In 2017 the festival site became listed on the National Register of Historic Places.","{4994, 3332, 4871, 3722, 2955, 3979, 144, 528, 1424, 3091, 3473, 663, 1307, 2717, 4895, 1824, 1058, 4516, 1192, 4138, 3371, 1584, 563, 948, 3252, 2487, 1464, 2104, 1979, 4923, 3005, 703, 576, 2241, 3777, 4287, 452, 580, 964, 583, 1222, 1605, 3272, 843, 4675, 1997, 3322, 463, 2767, 2004, 2901, 2647, 2522, 3676, 1757, 990, 4192, 1251, 3427, 2152, 3054, 498, 1783, 632, 3578, 4605, 4990}",67,"['Woodstock Music & Art Fair', 'New York State', ""Max Yasgur's"", 'August 15–18, 1969', ""Max Yasgur's"", 'Bethel', 'New York', 'Woodstock', '3 Days', 'the Bethel Rock Festival', '1970', 'Joni Mitchell', 'Crosby', 'Stills, Nash & Young', 'Matthews Southern Comfort', 'Woodstock', 'twentieth', 'fiftieth', '2004', 'Rolling Stone', 'Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll', '2017', 'the National Register of Historic Places']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG']"

During his career as a center, Abdul-Jabbar was a record six-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), a record 19-time NBA All-Star, a 15-time All-NBA selection, and an 11-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. A member of six NBA championship teams as a player and two more as an assistant coach, Abdul-Jabbar twice was voted NBA Finals MVP. In 1996, he was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. NBA coach Pat Riley and players Isiah Thomas and Julius Erving have called him the greatest basketball player of all time.After winning 71 consecutive basketball games on his high school team in New York City, Alcindor was recruited by Jerry Norman, the assistant coach of UCLA, where he played for coach John Wooden on three consecutive national championship teams and was a record three-time MVP of the NCAA Tournament. Drafted with the first overall pick by the one-season-old Bucks franchise in the 1969 NBA draft, Alcindor spent six seasons in Milwaukee. After leading the Bucks to its first NBA championship at age 24 in 1971, he took the Muslim name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Using his trademark ""skyhook"" shot, he established himself as one of the league's top scorers. In 1975, he was traded to the Lakers, with whom he played the final 14 seasons of his career and won five additional NBA championships. Abdul-Jabbar's contributions were a key component in the ""Showtime"" era of Lakers basketball. Over his 20-year NBA career, his teams succeeded in making the playoffs 18 times and got past the first round 14 times; his teams reached the NBA Finals on 10 occasions.
At the time of his retirement at age 42 in 1989, Abdul-Jabbar was the NBA's all-time leader in points scored (38,387), games played (1,560), minutes played (57,446), field goals made (15,837), field goal attempts (28,307), blocked shots (3,189), defensive rebounds (9,394), career wins (1,074), and personal fouls (4,657). He remains the all-time leader in points scored, field goals made, and career wins. He is ranked third all-time in both rebounds and blocked shots. In 2007, ESPN voted him the greatest center of all time, in 2008, they named him the ""greatest player in college basketball history"", and in 2016, they named him the second best player in NBA history (behind Michael Jordan). Abdul-Jabbar has also been an actor, a basketball coach, and a best-selling author. In 2012, he was selected by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to be a U.S. global cultural ambassador. In 2016, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.",set(),0,"['Milwaukee Bucks', 'NBA Draft', 'UCLA', 'Lew Alcindor', 'Kareem Abdul-Jabbar', 'Kareem Abdul-Jabbar', 'Ferdinand Lewis', 'Jr.', 'April 16, 1947', 'American', '20 seasons', 'the National Basketball Association', 'NBA', 'the Milwaukee Bucks', 'the Los Angeles Lakers', 'Abdul-Jabbar', 'All-NBA', 'NBA', 'Abdul-Jabbar', 'NBA Finals MVP', '1996', 'NBA History', 'NBA', 'Pat Riley', 'Isiah Thomas', 'Julius Erving', 'New York City', 'Jerry Norman', 'UCLA', 'John Wooden', 'one-season-old', 'Bucks', '1969', 'NBA', 'six seasons', 'Milwaukee', 'Bucks', 'NBA', 'age 24 in', '1971', 'Muslim', 'Kareem Abdul-Jabbar', '1975', 'Lakers', 'NBA', ""Abdul-Jabbar's"", 'Showtime', 'Lakers', 'NBA', 'the NBA Finals', 'age 42 in', '1989', 'Abdul-Jabbar', 'NBA', '2007', 'ESPN', '2008', '2016', 'NBA', 'Michael Jordan', 'Abdul-Jabbar', '2012', 'State', 'Hillary Clinton', 'U.S.', '2016', 'Barack Obama', 'the Presidential Medal of Freedom']","['PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART']"

Rhodesia was the de facto successor state to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia, which had been self-governing since achieving responsible government in 1923. A landlocked nation, Rhodesia was bordered by South Africa to the south, Bechuanaland (later Botswana) to the southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique (a Portuguese province until 1975) to the east. 
In the late 19th century, the territory north of the Transvaal was chartered to the British South Africa Company, led by Cecil Rhodes. Rhodes and his Pioneer Column marched north in 1890, acquiring a huge block of territory that the company would rule until the early 1920s. In 1923, the company's charter was revoked, and Southern Rhodesia attained self-government and established a legislature. Between 1953 and 1963, Southern Rhodesia was joined with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.
The decolonisation of Africa in the early 1960s alarmed a significant proportion of Rhodesia's white population. In an effort to delay the transition to black majority rule, Rhodesia's predominantly white government issued its own Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965.  (The government of the United Kingdom supported Rhodesia's transition to a multiracial democracy.) The UDI administration initially sought recognition as an autonomous realm within the Commonwealth of Nations, but reconstituted itself as a republic in 1970. The Rhodesian Bush War, which pitted the government against two African nationalist organisations, ZANU and ZAPU, intensified in the 1970s, prompting Rhodesian premier Ian Smith to concede to multiracial democracy in 1978. However, a provisional government subsequently headed by Smith and his moderate colleague Abel Muzorewa failed in appeasing international critics or halting the bloodshed. By December 1979, Muzorewa had replaced Smith as Prime Minister and secured an agreement with the militant nationalists, allowing Rhodesia to briefly revert to colonial status pending elections under a universal franchise. It finally achieved internationally recognised independence in April 1980 as the Republic of Zimbabwe.
Rhodesia's largest cities were its capital, Salisbury, and Bulawayo. The white population, which grew to nearly 300,000, dominated the country's politics and economy, though they never made up more than 8% of the total population. Rhodesia developed an economy largely dependent on agriculture, manufacturing, and mining. Its largest exports were chromium, tobacco, and steel. International sanctions put increasing pressure on the country as time went on. The unicameral Legislative Assembly was predominantly white, with minority of seats reserved for blacks. Following the declaration of a republic in 1970, this was replaced by a bicameral Parliament with a House of Assembly and a Senate. The Westminster system was retained, with the President acting as ceremonial head of state, and the Prime Minister, heading the Cabinet, as head of government.",set(),0,"['Rhodesia', 'Rhodesia', 'Africa', '1965 to 1979', 'Zimbabwe', 'Rhodesia', 'British', 'Southern Rhodesia', '1923', 'Rhodesia', 'South Africa', 'Bechuanaland', 'Botswana', 'Zambia', 'Mozambique', 'Portuguese', '1975', 'east', 'the late 19th century', 'Transvaal', 'the British South Africa Company', 'Cecil Rhodes', 'Pioneer', '1890', 'the early 1920s', '1923', 'Southern Rhodesia', 'Between 1953 and 1963', 'Southern Rhodesia', 'Northern Rhodesia', 'Nyasaland', 'the Federation of Rhodesia', 'Nyasaland', 'Africa', 'the early 1960s', 'Rhodesia', 'Rhodesia', 'the United Kingdom', '11 November 1965', 'the United Kingdom', 'Rhodesia', 'UDI', 'the Commonwealth of Nations', '1970', 'African', 'ZANU', 'ZAPU', 'the 1970s', 'Rhodesian', 'Ian Smith', '1978', 'Smith', 'Abel Muzorewa', 'December 1979', 'Muzorewa', 'Smith', 'Rhodesia', 'April 1980', 'the Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Rhodesia', 'Salisbury', 'Bulawayo', 'more than 8%', 'Rhodesia', 'Legislative Assembly', '1970', 'Parliament', 'House of Assembly', 'Senate', 'Westminster', 'Cabinet']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERCENT', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG']"

122,1970,July,6,"California passes 1st ""no fault"" divorce law",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce,"Divorce, also known as dissolution of marriage, is the process of terminating a marriage or marital union. Divorce usually entails the canceling or reorganizing of the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage, thus dissolving the bonds of matrimony between a married couple under the rule of law of the particular country or state. Divorce laws vary considerably around the world, but in most countries divorce requires the sanction of a court or other authority in a legal process, which may involve issues of distribution of property, child custody, alimony (spousal support), child visitation / access, parenting time, child support, and division of debt. In most countries, monogamy is required by law, so divorce allows each former partner to marry another person.
When those that are in a common-law relationship break up, it is referred to as separation, instead of a divorce.Divorce is different from annulment, which declares the marriage null and void, with legal separation or de jure separation (a legal process by which a married couple may formalize a de facto separation while remaining legally married) or with de facto separation (a process where the spouses informally stop cohabiting). Reasons for divorce vary, from sexual incompatibility or lack of independence for one or both spouses to a personality clash.The only countries that do not allow divorce are the Philippines, the Vatican City and the British Crown Dependency of Sark. In the Philippines, divorce for non-Muslim Filipinos is not legal unless the husband or wife is an alien and satisfies certain conditions. The Vatican City is an ecclesiastical state, which has no procedure for divorce. Countries that have relatively recently legalized divorce are Italy (1970), Portugal (1975, although from 1910 to 1940 was possible both for the civil and religious marriage), Brazil (1977), Spain (1981), Argentina (1987), Paraguay (1991), Colombia (1991; from 1976 was allowed only for non-Catholics), Andorra (1995), Ireland (1996), Chile (2004) and Malta (2011).","{640, 3713, 3970, 1795, 901, 7, 1547, 2703, 3727, 5019, 2590, 5022, 4768, 1566, 290, 2210, 2169, 3365, 4134, 4905, 4400, 561, 3508, 2875, 4539, 4549, 967, 968, 2122, 971, 2507, 4682, 4430, 4815, 2258, 595, 851, 3795, 4307, 5077, 3180, 889, 3834, 3451, 5117}",45,"['California', '1st', 'Divorce', 'Divorce', 'Philippines', 'the Vatican City', 'British', 'Sark', 'Philippines', 'non-Muslim', 'Filipinos', 'The Vatican City', 'Italy', '1970', 'Portugal', '1975', '1910 to 1940', 'Brazil', '1977', 'Spain', '1981', 'Argentina', '1987', 'Paraguay', '1991', 'Colombia', '1991', '1976', 'non-Catholics', 'Andorra', '1995', 'Ireland', '1996', 'Chile', '2004', 'Malta', '2011']","['GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"
123,1970,July,21,"Aswan High Dam opens in Egypt, enables human control of the flooding of the Nile",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire,"Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.  Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition.
Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen, O2, to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy (418 kJ per 32 g of O2); the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here.  At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced.  The flame is the visible portion of the fire. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen.  If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.
Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning.  Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe. The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems.
The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water. Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, but this fecundity can potentially be recovered as molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere is ""fixed"" and converted to ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning and by leguminous plants that are ""nitrogen-fixing"" such as clover, peas, and green beans.
Fire has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction.","{452, 2388}",2,"['Aswan High Dam', 'Egypt', 'Nile', 'Slower', 'O2']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON']"
124,1970,September,8,"Black September hijackings begin, three airliners hijacked and blown up by Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson%27s_Field_hijackings,"In September 1970, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) hijacked four airliners bound for New York City and one for London. Three aircraft were forced to land at Dawson's Field, a remote desert airstrip near Zarqa, Jordan, formerly Royal Air Force Station Zerqa, which then became PFLP's 'Revolutionary Airport'. By the end of the incident, one hijacker had been killed and one injury reported. This was the second instance of mass aircraft hijacking, after an escape from communist Czechoslovakia in 1950.
On 6 September, TWA Flight 741 from Frankfurt (a Boeing 707) and Swissair Flight 100 from Zürich (a Douglas DC-8) were forced to land at Dawson's Field. On the same day, the hijacking of El Al Flight 219 from Amsterdam (another 707) was foiled: hijacker Patrick Argüello was shot and killed, and his partner Leila Khaled was subdued and handed over to British authorities in London. Two PFLP hijackers, who were prevented from boarding the El Al flight,  hijacked instead Pan Am Flight 93, a Boeing 747, diverting the large plane first to Beirut and then to Cairo, rather than to the small Jordanian airstrip. On 9 September, a fifth plane, BOAC Flight 775, a Vickers VC10 coming from Bahrain, was hijacked by a PFLP sympathizer and taken to Dawson's Field in order to pressure the British to free Khaled.
While the majority of the 310 hostages were transferred to Amman and freed on 11 September, the PFLP segregated the flight crews and Jewish passengers, keeping the 56 Jewish hostages in custody, while releasing the non-Jews. Six hostages in particular were kept because they were men and American citizens, not necessarily Jews: Robert Norman Schwartz, a U.S. Defense Department researcher stationed in Thailand; James Lee Woods, Schwartz's assistant and security detail; Gerald Berkowitz, an American-born Jew and college chemistry professor; Rabbi Abraham Harrari-Raful and his brother Rabbi Joseph Harrari-Raful, two Brooklyn school teachers; and John Hollingsworth, a U.S. State Department employee. Schwartz, whose father was Jewish, was a convert to Catholicism. On 12 September, prior to their announced deadline, the PFLP used explosives to destroy the empty planes, as they anticipated a counterstrike.The PFLP's exploitation of Jordanian territory was an example of the increasingly autonomous Arab Palestinian activity within the Kingdom of Jordan – a serious challenge to the Hashemite monarchy of King Hussein. Hussein declared martial law on 16 September and from 17 to 27 September his forces deployed into Palestinian-controlled areas in what became known as Black September in Jordan, nearly triggering a regional war involving Syria, Iraq, and Israel.
A swift Jordanian victory, however, enabled a 30 September deal in which the remaining PFLP hostages were released in exchange for Khaled and three PFLP members in a Swiss prison.","{128, 1153, 3842, 1539, 640, 4611, 903, 2702, 1938, 3348, 1432, 157, 4768, 418, 290, 1699, 4134, 4007, 1583, 561, 4020, 182, 1847, 3768, 826, 4539, 1985, 4549, 1990, 967, 2122, 971, 2507, 4426, 4174, 4682, 1616, 4688, 4815, 467, 5074, 2391, 3834, 4700, 1888, 2529, 2018, 5088, 3686, 1640, 2794, 1388, 3180, 2415, 3951, 1780, 3190, 2169, 4474, 3451, 5117}",61,"['September', 'Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine', 'September 1970', 'the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine', 'New York City', 'London', ""Dawson's Field"", 'Zarqa', 'Jordan', 'Royal Air Force', 'PFLP', ""Revolutionary Airport'"", 'Czechoslovakia', '1950', '6 September', 'TWA', 'Flight 741', 'Frankfurt', 'Boeing', '707', 'Swissair', 'Flight 100', 'Zürich', 'Douglas', ""Dawson's Field"", 'the same day', 'El Al Flight', 'Amsterdam', 'Patrick Argüello', 'Leila Khaled', 'British', 'London', 'PFLP', 'El Al', 'Pan Am Flight 93', 'Boeing', '747', 'Beirut', 'Cairo', 'Jordanian', '9 September', 'BOAC Flight 775', 'Vickers VC10', 'Bahrain', ""Dawson's Field"", 'British', 'Khaled', 'Amman', '11 September', 'PFLP', 'Jewish', 'Jewish', 'non-Jews', 'American', 'Jews', 'Robert Norman Schwartz', 'U.S. Defense Department', 'Thailand', 'James Lee Woods', 'Schwartz', 'Gerald Berkowitz', 'American', 'Jew', 'Rabbi Abraham Harrari-Raful', 'Rabbi Joseph Harrari-Raful', 'Brooklyn', 'John Hollingsworth', 'U.S. State Department', 'Jewish', '12 September', 'PFLP', 'PFLP', 'Jordanian', 'Arab', 'Palestinian', 'the Kingdom of Jordan', 'Hashemite', 'King Hussein', 'Hussein', '16 September', '17 to 27 September', 'Palestinian', 'Black September', 'Jordan', 'Syria', 'Iraq', 'Israel', 'Jordanian', '30 September', 'Khaled', 'PFLP', 'Swiss']","['DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP']"
125,1970,November,3,US President Richard Nixon promises gradual troop removal of Vietnam,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Richard_Nixon,"The presidency of Richard Nixon began at noon EST on January 20, 1969, when Richard Nixon was inaugurated as 37th President of the United States, and ended on August 9, 1974, when he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office, the only U.S. president ever to do so. He was succeeded by Gerald Ford, whom he had appointed Vice President after Spiro Agnew was forced to resign. Nixon took office after the 1968 presidential election, in which he defeated incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Although Nixon had built his reputation as a  very active Republican campaigner, he downplayed partisanship in his 1972 landslide reelection.
Nixon's primary focus while in office was on foreign affairs. He focused on détente with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, easing Cold War tensions with both countries. As part of this policy, Nixon signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and SALT I, two landmark arms control treaties with the Soviet Union. Nixon promulgated the Nixon Doctrine, which called for indirect assistance by the United States rather than direct U.S. commitments as seen in the ongoing Vietnam War. After extensive negotiations with North Vietnam, Nixon withdrew the last U.S. soldiers from South Vietnam in 1973, ending the military draft that same year. To prevent the possibility of further U.S. intervention in Vietnam, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution over Nixon's veto.
In domestic affairs, Nixon advocated a policy of ""New Federalism,"" in which federal powers and responsibilities would be shifted to the states. However, he faced a Democratic Congress that did not share his goals and, in some cases, enacted legislation over his veto. Nixon's proposed reform of federal welfare programs did not pass Congress, but Congress did adopt one aspect of his proposal in the form of Supplemental Security Income, which provides aid to low-income individuals who are aged or disabled. The Nixon administration adopted a ""low profile"" on school desegregation, but the administration enforced court desegregation orders and implemented the first affirmative action plan in the United States. Nixon also presided over the creation of Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of major environmental laws like the Clean Water Act. Economically, the Nixon years saw the start of a period of ""stagflation"" that would continue into the 1970s.
Nixon was far ahead in the polls in the 1972 presidential election, but during the campaign, Nixon operatives conducted several illegal operations designed to undermine the opposition. They were exposed when the break-in of the Democratic National Committee Headquarters, ended in the arrest of five burglars and gave rise to a congressional investigation. Nixon denied any involvement in the break in, but, after a tape emerged revealing that Nixon had known about the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries shortly after they occurred, the House of Representatives initiated impeachment proceedings. Facing removal by Congress, Nixon resigned from office. Though some scholars believe that Nixon ""has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues"", Nixon is generally ranked as a below average president in surveys of historians and political scientists.","{4611, 2051, 4101, 2568, 524, 3598, 1573, 3109, 4134, 1576, 4647, 2096, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4174, 4688, 2141, 2155, 1646, 2159, 2169, 2682, 640, 1678, 2702, 2703, 4758, 1177, 2713, 1710, 182, 4799, 2760, 1739, 2764, 3277, 4815, 4307, 3799, 3803, 3808, 3812, 3303, 1780, 757, 4859, 1803, 1808, 3348, 3862, 807, 810, 812, 4920, 2368, 2891, 4430, 1873, 1370, 3936, 870, 873, 874, 3434, 1388, 3951, 4474, 3970, 387, 1422, 1938, 1432, 3994, 2984, 4014, 2483, 2995, 4020, 4024, 4539, 1985, 4549, 967, 971, 2507, 467, 3040, 4589, 5106}",90,"['US', 'Richard Nixon', 'Vietnam', 'Richard Nixon', 'January 20, 1969', 'Richard Nixon', 'the United States', 'August 9, 1974', 'U.S.', 'Gerald Ford', 'Spiro Agnew', 'Nixon', '1968', 'Hubert Humphrey', 'Nixon', 'Republican', '1972', 'Nixon', ""the People's Republic of China"", 'the Soviet Union', 'Cold War', 'Nixon', 'the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty', 'SALT', 'the Soviet Union', 'Nixon', 'Nixon', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'Vietnam War', 'North Vietnam', 'Nixon', 'U.S.', 'South Vietnam', '1973', 'same year', 'U.S.', 'Vietnam', 'Congress', 'the War Powers Resolution', 'Nixon', 'Nixon', 'New Federalism', 'Democratic', 'Congress', 'Nixon', 'Congress', 'Congress', 'Supplemental Security Income', 'Nixon', 'the United States', 'Nixon', 'Environmental Protection Agency', 'the Clean Water Act', 'Nixon', 'years', 'the 1970s', 'Nixon', '1972', 'Nixon', 'the Democratic National Committee Headquarters', 'Nixon', 'Nixon', 'White House', 'Watergate', 'the House of Representatives', 'Congress', 'Nixon', 'Nixon', 'Nixon']","['GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON']"

The trustees of Stanford University established SRI in 1946 as a center of innovation to support economic development in the region.
The organization was founded as the Stanford Research Institute. SRI formally separated from Stanford University in 1970 and became known as SRI International in 1977. SRI performs client-sponsored research and development for government agencies, commercial businesses, and private foundations. It also licenses its technologies, forms strategic partnerships, sells products, and creates spin-off companies.SRI's annual revenue in 2014 was approximately $540 million. SRI's headquarters are located near the Stanford University campus. William A. Jeffrey has served as SRI's president and CEO since September 2014.

128,1970,November,21,General Hafez al-Assad becomes Prime Minister of Syria following military coup,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez_al-Assad,"Hafez al-Assad (Arabic: حافظ الأسد‎ Ḥāfiẓ al-ʾAsad, Levantine Arabic: [ˈħaːfezˤ elˈʔasad], Modern Standard Arabic: [ħaːfɪðˤ al'ʔasad]; 6 October 1930 – 10 June 2000) was a Syrian politician who served as President of Syria from 1971 to 2000. He was also Prime Minister from 1970 to 1971, as well as Regional Secretary of the Regional Command of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party and Secretary General of the National Command of the Ba'ath Party from 1970 to 2000.
Assad participated in the 1963 Syrian coup d'état which brought the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party to power, and the new leadership appointed him Commander of the Syrian Air Force. In 1966, Assad participated in a second coup, which toppled the traditional leaders of the Ba'ath Party and brought a radical military faction headed by Salah Jadid to power. Assad was appointed defense minister by the new government. Four years later, Assad initiated a third coup which ousted Jadid, and appointed himself as the undisputed leader of Syria.
Assad de-radicalised the Ba'ath government when he took power by giving more space to private property and by strengthening the country's foreign relations with countries which his predecessor had deemed reactionary. He sided with the Soviet Union during the Cold War in turn for support against Israel, and, while he had forsaken the pan-Arab concept of unifying the Arab world into one Arab nation, he sought to make Syria the defender of Arab interests against Israel. When he came to power, Assad organised state services along sectarian lines (the Sunnis became the heads of political institutions, while the Alawites took control of the military, intelligence, and security apparatuses). The formerly collegial powers of Ba'athist decision-making were curtailed, and were transferred to the Syrian presidency. The Syrian government ceased to be a one-party system in the normal sense of the word, and was turned into a one-party state with a strong presidency. To maintain this system, a cult of personality centered on Assad and his family was created by the president and Ba'ath party.Having become the main source of initiative inside the Syrian government, Assad began looking for a successor. His first choice was his brother Rifaat, but Rifaat attempted to seize power in 1983–84 when Hafez's health was in doubt. Rifaat was subsequently exiled when Hafez's health recovered. Hafez's next choice of successor was his eldest son, Bassel. However, Bassel died in a car accident in 1994, and Hafez turned to his third choice—his younger son Bashar, who at that time had no political experience. This move was met with criticism within some quarters of the Syrian ruling class, but Assad persisted with his plan and demoted several officials who opposed this succession. Hafez died in 2000 and Bashar succeeded him as President.","{632, 4608, 580}",3,"['Hafez al-Assad', 'Syria', 'Hafez al-Assad', 'Arabic', 'Ḥāfiẓ al-ʾAsad', 'Levantine Arabic', '6 October 1930', '10 June 2000', 'Syrian', 'Syria', '1971 to 2000', '1970 to 1971', 'the Regional Command', 'Syrian', ""the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party"", ""the National Command of the Ba'ath Party"", '1970 to 2000', '1963', 'Syrian', ""d'état"", 'Syrian', ""the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party"", 'the Syrian Air Force', '1966', 'Assad', ""the Ba'ath Party"", 'Salah Jadid', 'Assad', 'Four years later', 'Assad', 'Jadid', 'Syria', 'the Soviet Union', 'the Cold War', 'Israel', 'pan-Arab', 'Arab', 'Arab', 'Syria', 'Arab', 'Israel', 'Assad', 'Sunnis', 'Alawites', ""Ba'athist"", 'Syrian', 'Syrian', 'Assad', 'Syrian', 'Assad', 'Rifaat', 'Rifaat', 'Hafez', 'Rifaat', 'Hafez', 'Hafez', 'Bassel', 'Bassel', '1994', 'Hafez', 'Bashar', 'Syrian', 'Assad', 'Hafez', '2000', 'Bashar']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'LANGUAGE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON']"

The ACB was established in 1970 and was once part of the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC), which was dissolved in 2006. The Department of Communications and the Arts now provides administrative support to the ACB and decisions made by the ACB may be reviewed by the Australian Classification Review Board. The ACB now operates under the Commonwealth Classification Act 1995.
The ACB does not directly censor material by ordering cuts or changes. However, it is able to effectively censor media by refusing classification and making the media illegal for hire, exhibition and importation to Australia.
The classification system has several levels of ""restricted"" categories, prohibiting sale, exhibition or use of some materials to those who are under a prescribed age. In 2005, video and computer games became subject to the same classification ratings and restrictions as films (with the exception of the R18+ and X18+ ratings), in response to confusion by parents.

131,1970,July,4,"Casey Kasem's ""American Top 40"" debuts on LA radio",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Top_40,"American Top 40 (commonly abbreviated to AT40) is an internationally syndicated, independent song countdown radio program created by Casey Kasem, Don Bustany, Tom Rounds and Ron Jacobs. The program is currently hosted by Ryan Seacrest and presented as an adjunct to his weekday radio program, On Air with Ryan Seacrest.
Originally a production of Watermark Inc. (later a division of ABC Radio known as ABC Watermark, now Cumulus Media Networks), AT40 is now distributed by Premiere Networks (a division of iHeartMedia). Nearly 430 radio stations in the United States, and several other territories worldwide air AT40 making it one of the most listened-to weekly radio programs in the world. It can also be heard on iHeartRadio, TuneIn and the official AT40 applications on mobile smartphones and tablets as well as on Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 consoles (via iHeartRadio's console app) and the Armed Forces Network. GEICO is the main sponsor for the show.
Co-creator Casey Kasem hosted the original AT40 from its inauguration on July 4, 1970, until August 6, 1988. Shadoe Stevens took over the program on August 13, 1988, and hosted until January 28, 1995, when the original program came to an end. Three years later, Kasem teamed up with Premiere's predecessor AMFM Radio Networks to relaunch AT40. Kasem, who had spent nine years hosting his own countdown for Westwood One, returned to hosting his creation on March 28, 1998. Seacrest took over AT40 on January 10, 2004, following Kasem's retirement from the series.
Currently, AT40 with Seacrest airs in two different formats, with one distributed to Contemporary Hit Radio (Top 40) stations and the other to Hot Adult Contemporary stations. However, there is no distinction made between the two shows on air. There are also two classic editions of the original AT40 distributed every weekend, featuring past Kasem-hosted shows from the 1970s and 1980s.
In its early years, the AT40 used the Billboard charts to compile the countdown, touting it as ""the only source"". The program subsequently switched to being based on Radio and Records airplay data upon its late 1990s return. The current source for the AT40 charts are unpublished mainstream Top 40 and hot adult contemporary charts compiled by Mediabase.
Through most of the 1980s, the countdown was compiled by Stu Jacobs.

133,1970,March,30,"Miles Davis's influential double album ""Bitches Brew"" released",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis,"Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926 – September 28, 1991) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.Born in Alton, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, Davis left to study at the Juilliard School in New York City, before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions for Capitol Records, which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz. In the early 1950s, Miles Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music while on Prestige Records but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955, he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records and recorded the 1957 album 'Round About Midnight. It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers, key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans, such as the Spanish-influenced Sketches of Spain (1960), and band recordings, such as Milestones (1958) and Kind of Blue (1959). The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time, having sold over five million copies in the U.S.
Davis made several lineup changes while recording Someday My Prince Will Come (1961), his 1961 Blackhawk concerts, and Seven Steps to Heaven (1963), another mainstream success that introduced bassist Ron Carter, pianist Herbie Hancock, and drummer Tony Williams. After adding saxophonist Wayne Shorter to his new quintet in 1964, Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the post-bop genre with albums such as E.S.P (1965) and Miles Smiles (1967), before transitioning into his electric period. During the 1970s, he  experimented with rock, funk, African rhythms, emerging electronic music technology, and an ever-changing line-up of musicians, including keyboardist Joe Zawinul, drummer Al Foster, and guitarist John McLaughlin. This period, beginning with Davis' 1969 studio album In a Silent Way and concluding with the 1975 concert recording Agharta, was the most controversial in his career, alienating and challenging many in jazz. His million-selling 1970 record Bitches Brew helped spark a resurgence in the genre's commercial popularity with jazz fusion as the decade progressed.After a five-year retirement due to poor health, Davis resumed his career in the 1980s, employing younger musicians and pop sounds on albums such as The Man with the Horn (1981) and Tutu (1986). Critics were generally unreceptive but the decade garnered the trumpeter his highest level of commercial recognition. He performed sold-out concerts worldwide, while branching out into visual arts, film, and television work, before his death in 1991 from the combined effects of a stroke, pneumonia and respiratory failure. In 2006, Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which recognized him as ""one of the key figures in the history of jazz."" Rolling Stone described him as ""the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time, not to mention one of the most important musicians of the 20th century,"" while Gerald Early called him inarguably one of the most influential and innovative musicians of that period.",set(),0,"[""Miles Davis's"", 'Bitches Brew', 'Miles Dewey Davis III', 'May 26, 1926', 'September 28, 1991', 'American', '20th-century', 'Davis', 'five-decade', 'Alton', 'Illinois', 'East St. Louis', 'Davis', 'the Juilliard School', 'New York City', ""Charlie Parker's"", '1944 to 1948', 'the Birth of the Cool', 'Capitol Records', 'the early 1950s', 'Miles Davis', 'bop', 'Prestige Records', 'the Newport Jazz Festival', '1955', 'Columbia Records', '1957', 'Round About Midnight', 'John Coltrane', 'Paul Chambers', 'the early 1960s', 'Gil Evans', 'Spanish', '1960', 'Milestones', '1958', 'Kind of Blue', '1959', 'U.S.', '1961', '1963', 'Ron Carter', 'Herbie Hancock', 'Tony Williams', 'Wayne Shorter', '1964', 'Davis', 'E.S.P', '1965', 'Miles Smiles', '1967', 'the 1970s', 'African', 'Joe Zawinul', 'Al Foster', 'John McLaughlin', 'Davis', '1969', 'a Silent Way', '1975', 'Agharta', '1970', 'Bitches Brew', 'the decade', 'five-year', 'Davis', 'the 1980s', 'The Man with the Horn (', '1981', 'Tutu', '1986', 'the decade', '1991', '2006', 'Davis', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame', 'Rolling Stone', 'the 20th century', 'Gerald Early']","['PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'LANGUAGE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON']"
134,1970,April,10,Paul McCartney officially announces the split of The Beatles,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_It_Be_(Beatles_album),"Let It Be is the twelfth and final studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 8 May 1970, almost a month after the group's break-up, in tandem with the motion picture of the same name. Like most of the band's previous releases, the album topped record charts in many countries, including both the US and the UK. However, the critical response was generally unfavourable, and Let It Be came to be regarded as one of the most controversial rock albums ever.Rehearsals began at Twickenham Film Studios in January 1969 as part of a planned documentary showing the Beatles' return to live performance. Paul McCartney conceived the project as an attempt to reinvigorate the band by returning to simpler rock and roll configurations. The filmed rehearsals were marked by ill-feeling, leading to George Harrison's temporary departure from the group. As a condition of his return, the members reconvened at their own Apple Studio with guest keyboardist Billy Preston. The project then yielded a single public concert, held impromptu on the studio's rooftop on 30 January, from which three of the album's tracks were drawn.
In April 1969, the Beatles issued the single ""Get Back"", after which engineer Glyn Johns proposed rejected mixes of the album, then titled Get Back, that were widely bootlegged before release. From then, the project lay in limbo as they moved onto the recording of Abbey Road, released that September. By then, John Lennon had departed the group. In January 1970, the remaining Beatles finished the album with the completion of ""Let It Be"" and ""I Me Mine"". The former was issued as a single in April 1970, and like all the album's recording to this point, was produced by George Martin.
Get Back was ultimately assembled under the title of Let It Be by the American producer Phil Spector in early 1970. He omitted ""Don't Let Me Down"", the B-side of the ""Get Back"" single, and instead included a 1968 take of ""Across the Universe"". Spector also included excerpts of studio chatter and applied original orchestral and choir overdubs to four tracks. The additions offended McCartney, particularly in the case of ""The Long and Winding Road"". In 2003, he spearheaded Let It Be... Naked, an alternative mix of Let It Be that removes Spector's embellishments.","{2176, 131, 3460, 903, 521, 3979, 4235, 3727, 528, 401, 3090, 5010, 1562, 3869, 2589, 1566, 4895, 2210, 2213, 3365, 1319, 1576, 2856, 4905, 5033, 4014, 1711, 4400, 4913, 563, 3508, 309, 311, 4407, 1081, 2875, 4413, 1600, 3777, 964, 2628, 4807, 5065, 971, 2891, 717, 1997, 4941, 5067, 3795, 4307, 5077, 3544, 3034, 2652, 3804, 3040, 2018, 2149, 3303, 4971, 492, 748, 1133, 2798, 368, 1136, 4718, 3702, 1783, 1272, 2297, 3322, 3195, 4990, 4991}",76,"['Paul McCartney', 'Beatles', 'English', 'Beatles', '8 May 1970', 'almost a month', 'US', 'UK', 'Twickenham Film Studios', 'January 1969', 'Beatles', 'Paul McCartney', ""George Harrison's"", 'Apple', 'Billy Preston', '30 January', 'April 1969', 'Beatles', 'Get Back', 'Glyn Johns', 'Abbey Road', 'September', 'John Lennon', 'January 1970', 'Beatles', 'Let It Be', 'I Me Mine""', 'April 1970', 'George Martin', 'American', 'Phil Spector', 'early 1970', 'the ""Get Back""', '1968', 'Across the Universe', 'McCartney', 'The Long and Winding Road', '2003']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE']"
135,1970,April,17,"Paul McCartney's 1st solo album ""McCartney"" is released",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney,"Sir James Paul McCartney  (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer, songwriter, musician, composer, and record and film producer who gained worldwide fame as co-lead vocalist and bassist for the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with John Lennon remains the most successful in history. After the group disbanded in 1970, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.
A self-taught musician, McCartney is proficient on bass, guitar, keyboards, and drums. He is known for his melodic approach to bass-playing (mainly playing with a plectrum), his versatile and wide tenor vocal range (spanning over four octaves), and his eclecticism (exploring styles ranging from pre-rock and roll pop to classical and electronica). McCartney began his career as a member of the Quarrymen in 1957, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Starting with the 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, he gradually became the Beatles' de facto leader, providing the creative impetus for most of their music and film projects. His Beatles songs ""And I Love Her"" (1964), ""Yesterday"" (1965), ""Eleanor Rigby"" (1966) and ""Blackbird"" (1968) rank among the most covered songs in history.In 1970, McCartney debuted as a solo artist with the album McCartney. Throughout the 1970s, he led Wings, one of the most successful bands of the decade, with more than a dozen international top 10 singles and albums. McCartney resumed his solo career in 1980. Since 1989, he has toured consistently as a solo artist. In 1993, he formed the music duo the Fireman with Youth of Killing Joke. Beyond music, he has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. In 1999, he was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), and was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century award. That same year, Pelé was elected Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee. According to the IFFHS, Pelé is the most successful domestic league goal-scorer in football history scoring 650 goals in 694 League matches, and in total 1281 goals in 1363 games, which included unofficial friendlies and is a Guinness World Record. During his playing days, Pelé was for a period the best-paid athlete in the world.
Pelé began playing for Santos at age 15 and the Brazil national team at 16. During his international career, he won three FIFA World Cups: 1958, 1962 and 1970, being the only player ever to do so. Pelé is the all-time leading goalscorer for Brazil with 77 goals in 92 games. At club level he is the record goalscorer for Santos, and led them to the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores. Known for connecting the phrase ""The Beautiful Game"" with football, Pelé's ""electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals"" made him a star around the world, and his teams toured internationally in order to take full advantage of his popularity. Since retiring in 1977, Pelé has been a worldwide ambassador for football and has made many acting and commercial ventures. In 2010, he was named the Honorary President of the New York Cosmos.
Averaging almost a goal per game throughout his career, Pelé was adept at striking the ball with either foot in addition to anticipating his opponents' movements on the field. While predominantly a striker, he could also drop deep and take on a playmaking role, providing assists with his vision and passing ability, and he would also use his dribbling skills to go past opponents. In Brazil, he is hailed as a national hero for his accomplishments in football and for his outspoken support of policies that improve the social conditions of the poor. Throughout his career and in his retirement, Pelé received several individual and team awards for his performance in the field, his record-breaking achievements, and legacy in the sport.","{4736, 1153, 3332, 1288, 2955, 524, 3979, 2702, 4235, 528, 1424, 3091, 663, 2590, 2080, 2210, 3874, 4516, 4642, 3110, 680, 4138, 2171, 1583, 3252, 4407, 1979, 4413, 4287, 1730, 453, 4550, 3272, 4426, 4561, 467, 4307, 2901, 3034, 1757, 990, 606, 2525, 97, 1633, 1251, 1508, 2278, 3686, 1640, 2793, 2026, 4971, 2415, 3951, 1526, 3195, 4990}",58,"['FIFA World Cup Final', 'Estadio Azteca', 'Mexico City', 'Brazil', 'World Cup 3', 'Italy', 'Edson Arantes', 'Brazilian', 'Portuguese', '23 October 1940', 'Pelé', 'Brazilian', '1999', 'World Player of the Century', 'the International Federation of Football History & Statistics', 'FIFA', 'Pelé', 'Athlete of the Century', 'the International Olympic Committee', 'Pelé', 'League', '1281', '1363', 'friendlies', 'his playing days', 'Pelé', 'Pelé', 'Santos', 'age 15', 'Brazil', '1958', '1962', '1970', 'Brazil', 'Santos', '1962', '1963', 'Copa Libertadores', 'The Beautiful Game', 'Pelé', '1977', 'Pelé', '2010', 'the New York Cosmos', 'Pelé', 'Brazil']","['ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE']"

Popularly known as the ""Butcher of Uganda"", he is considered one of the cruellest despots in world history.Amin was born in Koboko to a Kakwa father and Lugbara mother. In 1946, he joined the King's African Rifles (KAR) of the British Colonial Army as a cook. He rose to the rank of lieutenant, taking part in British actions against Somali rebels in the Shifta War and then the Mau Mau rebels in Kenya. Uganda gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1962, and Amin remained in the armed forces, rising to the position of major and being appointed Commander of the Uganda Army in 1965. He became aware that Ugandan President Milton Obote was planning to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, so he launched a military coup in 1971 and declared himself President.
During his years in power, Amin shifted from being a pro-Western ruler enjoying considerable support from Israel to being backed by Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko, the Soviet Union, and East Germany. In 1975, Amin became the chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), a Pan-Africanist group designed to promote solidarity among African states. Uganda was a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights from 1977 to 1979. The UK broke diplomatic relations with Uganda in 1977, and Amin declared that he had defeated the British and added ""CBE"" to his title for ""Conqueror of the British Empire"". Radio Uganda then announced his entire title: ""His Excellency President for Life, Field Marshal Alhaji Dr. Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, CBE"".As Amin's rule progressed into the late 1970s, there was increased unrest against his persecution of certain ethnic groups and political dissidents, along with Uganda's very poor international standing due to Amin's support for the terrorist hijackers in Operation Entebbe. He then attempted to annexe Tanzania's Kagera Region in 1978, so Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere had his troops invade Uganda; they captured Kampala on 11 April 1979 and ousted Amin from power. Amin then went into exile, first in Libya and then in Saudi Arabia, where he lived until his death on 16 August 2003.
Amin's rule was characterised by rampant human rights abuses, political repression, ethnic persecution, extrajudicial killings, nepotism, corruption, and gross economic mismanagement.

145,1971,February,14,Richard Nixon installs secret taping system in the White House,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_White_House_tapes,"The Nixon White House tapes are audio recordings of conversations between U.S. President Richard Nixon and Nixon administration officials, Nixon family members, and White House staff, produced between 1971 and 1973.In February 1971, a sound-activated taping system was installed in the Oval Office, including in Nixon's Oval Office desk, using Sony TC-800B open-reel tape recorders to capture audio transmitted by telephone taps and concealed microphones. The system was expanded to include other rooms within the White House and Camp David. The system was turned off on July 18, 1973, two days after it became public knowledge as a result of the Senate Watergate Committee hearings.  Nixon was not the first president to record his White House conversations; President Franklin D. Roosevelt recorded Oval Office press conferences for a short period in 1940.The tapes' existence came to light during the Watergate scandal of 1973 and 1974, when the system was mentioned during the televised testimony of White House aide Alexander Butterfield before the Senate Watergate Committee. Nixon's refusal of a congressional subpoena to release the tapes constituted an article of impeachment against Nixon, and led to his subsequent resignation on August 9, 1974.On August 19, 2013, the Nixon Library and the National Archives and Records Administration released the final 340 hours of the tapes that cover the period from April 9 through July 12, 1973.","{640, 1153, 3970, 515, 4736, 4993, 3727, 3348, 1432, 4895, 4768, 418, 2210, 3874, 4770, 2342, 3110, 680, 4134, 4775, 1583, 4020, 4539, 1730, 453, 4549, 967, 2122, 971, 2507, 4682, 4815, 4561, 467, 3795, 4307, 5077, 2391, 4825, 730, 606, 1633, 1508, 997, 2793, 234, 2794, 1388, 4589, 4971, 2415, 3951, 1526, 3190, 2169, 4474, 3581, 4986}",58,"['Richard Nixon', 'the White House', 'Nixon', 'White House', 'U.S.', 'Richard Nixon', 'Nixon', 'Nixon', 'White House', 'between 1971', 'February 1971', 'the Oval Office', 'Nixon', 'Oval Office', 'Sony', 'the White House', 'Camp David', 'July 18, 1973', 'two days', 'the Senate Watergate Committee', 'Nixon', 'White House', 'Franklin D.

146,1971,March,26,Bangladesh (East Pakistan) under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declares its independence from Pakistan,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman,"Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Bengali: শেখ মুজিবুর রহমান; 17 March 1920 – 15 August 1975), shortened as Sheikh Mujib or just Mujib, was a Bangladeshi politician and statesman. He is called the ""Father of the Nation"" in Bangladesh. He served as the first President of Bangladesh and later as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh from 17 April 1971 until his assassination on 15 August 1975. He is considered to be the driving force behind the independence of Bangladesh. He is popularly dubbed with the title of ""Bangabandhu"" (Bôngobondhu ""Friend of Bengal"") by the people of Bangladesh. He became a leading figure in and eventually the leader of the Awami League, founded in 1949 as an East Pakistan–based political party in Pakistan. Mujib is credited as an important figure in efforts to gain political autonomy for East Pakistan and later as the central figure behind the Bangladesh Liberation Movement and the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Thus, he is regarded ""Jatir Janak"" or ""Jatir Pita"" (Jatir Jônok or Jatir Pita, both meaning ""Father of the Nation"") of Bangladesh. His daughter Sheikh Hasina is the current leader of the Awami League and also the Prime Minister of Bangladesh.
An initial advocate of democracy and socialism, Mujib rose to the ranks of the Awami League and East Pakistani politics as a charismatic and forceful orator. He became popular for his opposition to the ethnic and institutional discrimination of Bengalis in Pakistan, who comprised the majority of the state's population. At the heightening of sectional tensions, he outlined a six-point autonomy plan and was jailed by the regime of Field Marshal Ayub Khan for treason. Mujib led the Awami League to win the first democratic election of Pakistan in 1970. Despite gaining a majority, the League was not invited by the ruling military junta to form a government. As civil disobedience erupted across East Pakistan, Mujib indirectly announced independence of Bangladesh during a landmark speech on 7 March 1971. On 26 March 1971, the Pakistan Army responded to the mass protests with Operation Searchlight, in which Prime Minister–elect Mujib was arrested and flown to solitary confinement in West Pakistan, while Bengali civilians, students, intellectuals, politicians and military defectors were murdered as part of the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. During Mujib's absence, many Bengalis joined the Mukti Bahini and, helped by the Indian Armed Forces, defeated the Pakistan Armed Forces during the Bangladesh Liberation War. After Bangladesh's independence, Mujib was released from Pakistani custody due to international pressure and returned to Dhaka in January 1972 after a short visit to Britain and India.
Sheikh Mujib became the Prime Minister of Bangladesh under a parliamentary system adopted by the new country. He charged the provisional parliament to write a new constitution proclaiming the four fundamental principles of ""nationalism, secularism, democracy, and socialism"", which reflect his political views collectively known as Mujibism. The Awami League won a huge mandate in the country's first general election in 1973. However, Mujib faced challenges of rampant unemployment, poverty and corruption, as well as the Bangladesh famine of 1974. The government was criticized for denying constitutional recognition to indigenous minorities and human rights violations by its security forces, notably the National Defence Force paramilitary. Amid rising political agitation, Mujib initiated one party socialist rule in January 1975. Six months later, he and most of his family were assassinated by renegade army officers during a coup. A martial law government was subsequently established. In a 2004 BBC poll, Mujib was voted the Greatest Bengali of all time.",set(),0,"['East Pakistan', 'Mujibur Rahman', 'Pakistan', 'Mujibur Rahman', 'Bengali', 'March 1920', '15 August 1975', 'Sheikh Mujib', 'Mujib', 'Bangladeshi', 'Father of the Nation', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladesh', 'April 1971', '15 August 1975', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangabandhu', 'Bangladesh', 'the Awami League', '1949', 'East Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'Mujib', 'East Pakistan', 'the Bangladesh Liberation Movement', 'the Bangladesh Liberation War', '1971', 'Jatir Janak', 'Jatir Pita', 'Jatir Jônok', 'Jatir Pita', 'Father of the Nation', 'Bangladesh', 'Sheikh Hasina', 'the Awami League', 'Bangladesh', 'Mujib', 'the Awami League', 'East Pakistani', 'Bengalis', 'Pakistan', 'Ayub Khan', 'Mujib', 'the Awami League', 'Pakistan', '1970', 'League', 'East Pakistan', 'Mujib', 'Bangladesh', '7 March 1971', 'March 1971', 'the Pakistan Army', 'Mujib', 'West Pakistan', 'Bengali', '1971', 'Bangladesh', 'Mujib', 'Bengalis', 'the Mukti Bahini', 'the Indian Armed Forces', 'the Pakistan Armed Forces', 'the Bangladesh Liberation War', 'Bangladesh', 'Mujib', 'Pakistani', 'Dhaka', 'January 1972', 'Britain', 'India', 'Mujib', 'Bangladesh', 'The Awami League', '1973', 'Mujib', 'Bangladesh', '1974', 'the National Defence Force', 'Mujib', 'January 1975', 'Six months later', '2004', 'BBC', 'Mujib']","['GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG']"
147,1971,July,9,Henry Kissinger visits the People's Republic of China to negotiate a detente between the US and China,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_relations,"China–United States relations (simplified Chinese: 中美关系; traditional Chinese: 中美關係; pinyin: Zhōngměi Guānxì), also known as U.S.–Chinese relations, Chinese–U.S. relations, or Sino-American relations, refers to international relations between China and the United States. The history of the relationship can be traced back to when the United States first gained independence. The relationship between the two countries have been, until recent years, quite strong, complex, and even somewhat positive in various aspects. Both countries used to have an extremely extensive economic partnership, and the great amount of trade between the two countries necessitated for constructive political relations, but significant issues still exist. The relationship is of economic cooperation, hegemonic rivalry in the Pacific, and mutual suspicion over each other's intentions. Therefore, each nation has adopted a wary attitude regarding the other as a potential adversary but has meanwhile maintained an extremely strong economic partnership. It has been described by world leaders and academics as the world's most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century.As of 2019, the United States has the world's largest economy and China has the second largest although China has a larger GDP when measured by PPP. Historically, relations between the two countries have generally been stable with some periods of open conflict, most notably during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Currently, China and the United States have mutual political, economic, and security interests, such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons, but there are unresolved concerns relating to the role of democracy in government in China and human rights in China. China is the second largest foreign creditor of the United States, after Japan. The two countries remain in dispute over territorial issues in the South China Sea.According to a 2017 BBC World Service poll, 33% of the Chinese view America's influence positively, and 61% express a negative view. Likewise, only 22% of Americans view China's influence positively, and 70% view it negatively.
According to a 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center, 26% of Americans have a favorable view of China, with 60% expressing an unfavorable view. The poll also found that 24% of Americans see China as the top threat to the US. Relations with China began under US President George Washington, leading to the 1845 Treaty of Wangxia. The US was allied to the Republic of China during the Pacific War but, after the Communist victory in Mainland China during the Chinese Civil War, fought a major armed conflict with the People's Republic of China in the Korean War and did not establish relations for 25 years, until President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. Since Nixon's visit, every US president, with the exception of Jimmy Carter, has toured China. Relations with China have strained under President Barack Obama's Asia pivot strategy and his support for Japan in the Senkaku Islands dispute. Despite tensions during his term, the Chinese population's favorability of the US stood at 51% in Obama's last year of 2016, only to dip during the Trump administration.The relations deteriorated sharply under President Donald Trump, whose administration launched a trade war against China, banned US companies from selling equipment to Huawei, increased visa restrictions on Chinese nationality students and scholars and designated China as a currency manipulator. During the Trump administration, and especially since the US-China trade war began, political observers have started to warn that a new cold war is emerging. Michael D. Swaine warned in 2019, ""The often positive and optimistic forces, interests, and beliefs that sustained bilateral ties for decades are giving way to undue pessimism, hostility, and a zero-sum mindset in almost every area of engagement."" However by 2020, the two countries have started to take steps to repair the relations; the US lifted its currency manipulator designation on China on 13 January 2020, and both countries signed the US–China Phase One trade deal on 15 January.","{2176, 4608, 643, 260, 771, 1929, 511, 140, 1676, 2317, 528, 145, 401, 5010, 2717, 2205, 2856, 42, 683, 3243, 4526, 1711, 4913, 4661, 1080, 1600, 3777, 580, 4807, 328, 329, 74, 3413, 2652, 1629, 2525, 2399, 4192, 5090, 996, 741, 4718, 2417, 3827, 2039, 2297, 4991}",47,"['Henry Kissinger', ""the People's Republic of China"", 'US', 'China', 'China', 'United States', 'Chinese', 'Chinese', 'Zhōngměi Guānxì', 'Chinese', 'U.S.', 'Sino-American', 'China', 'the United States', 'the United States', 'recent years', 'Pacific', 'the 21st century', '2019', 'the United States', 'China', 'China', 'the Korean War', 'the Vietnam War', 'China', 'the United States', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'the South China Sea', '2017', 'BBC World Service', '33%', 'Chinese', 'America', '61%', 'only 22%', 'Americans', 'China', '70%', '2019', 'the Pew Research Center', '26%', 'Americans', 'China', '60%', '24%', 'Americans', 'China', 'US', 'China', 'US', 'George Washington', '1845', 'Wangxia', 'US', 'the Republic of China', 'the Pacific War', 'Communist', 'Mainland China', 'the Chinese Civil War', ""the People's Republic of China"", 'the Korean War', '25 years', 'Richard Nixon', '1972', 'China', 'Nixon', 'US', 'Jimmy Carter', 'China', 'China', 'Barack Obama', 'Asia', 'Japan', 'Senkaku Islands', 'Chinese', 'US', '51%', 'Obama', 'last year of 2016', 'Trump', 'Donald Trump', 'China', 'US', 'Huawei', 'Chinese', 'China', 'Trump', 'US', 'China', 'Michael D.

148,1971,October,25,United Nations votes to expel the Chinese Nationalist ruled Taiwan and admit the Communist People's Republic of China,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_the_United_Nations,"China is one of the charter members of the United Nations and is one of five permanent members of its Security Council.
One of the victorious Allies of the Second World War (locally known as the Second Sino-Japanese War), the Republic of China (ROC) joined the UN upon its founding in 1945. The subsequent resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. Nearly all of the Chinese mainland was soon under its control and the ROC retreated to the island refuge of Taiwan. The One-China policy advocated by both governments dismantled the solution of dual representation but, amid the Cold War and Korean War, the United States and its allies opposed the replacement of the ROC at the United Nations until 1971, although they were persuaded to pressure the government of the ROC to accept international recognition of Mongolia's independence in 1961. The United Kingdom, France, and other United States allies individually shifted their recognitions of China to the PRC and Albania brought annual votes to replace the ROC with the PRC, but these were defeated since—after General Assembly Resolution 1668—a change in recognition required a two-thirds vote.
Amid the Sino-Soviet split and Vietnam War, United States President Richard Nixon entered into negotiations with Communist Chairman Mao, initially through a secret 1971 trip undertaken by Henry Kissinger to visit Zhou Enlai. On 25 October 1971, Albania's motion to recognize the People's Republic of China as the sole legal China was passed as General Assembly Resolution 2758. It was supported by most of the communist states (including the Soviet Union) and non-aligned countries (such as India), but also by some United States allies such as the United Kingdom and France. After the PRC was seated on 15 November 1971, Nixon then personally visited China the next year, beginning the normalization of Sino-American relations. Since that time, the Republic of China has softened its own One-China Policy and sought international recognition. These moves have been opposed and mostly blocked by the People's Republic of China, forcing the Republic of China to join international organizations under other names, including ""Chinese Taipei"" at the International Olympic Committee.
The Republic of China's most recent request for admission was turned down in 2007, but a number of European governments—led by the United States—protested to the UN's Office of Legal Affairs to force the global body and its secretary-general to stop using the reference “Taiwan is a part of China”.","{2051, 1027, 4611, 2568, 524, 1036, 4123, 4642, 4134, 4647, 1576, 4140, 2095, 4661, 1591, 4674, 3154, 595, 3666, 3158, 2141, 606, 607, 608, 3174, 3690, 3180, 1133, 3185, 3186, 4210, 2169, 4730, 2171, 4221, 4736, 2177, 131, 4235, 654, 2702, 3727, 1682, 4756, 1177, 2713, 2721, 2210, 2215, 4775, 174, 1711, 182, 4798, 1729, 4802, 3268, 199, 202, 718, 4815, 208, 4307, 213, 1752, 4315, 1244, 744, 747, 748, 1780, 4853, 4342, 248, 3322, 257, 1282, 1795, 3842, 4874, 271, 4879, 273, 3348, 794, 4895, 290, 803, 3874, 1319, 3879, 4395, 4400, 4915, 310, 311, 1847, 826, 4413, 830, 832, 325, 4940, 847, 2896, 1370, 3932, 1374, 355, 875, 3951, 370, 1908, 4981, 886, 889, 3451, 4990, 3970, 3463, 1931, 2955, 912, 1938, 3989, 1432, 4007, 4526, 4016, 2483, 2995, 437, 4020, 1979, 1985, 3524, 965, 1990, 967, 2507, 467, 981, 2525, 3040, 2018, 4579, 2536, 5110, 4605}",149,"['United Nations', 'Chinese', 'Nationalist', 'Taiwan', 'China', 'the United Nations', 'Security Council', 'the Second World War', 'Sino-Japanese', 'the Republic of China', 'ROC', 'UN', '1945', 'the Chinese Civil War', ""the People's Republic of China"", 'PRC', '1949', 'Chinese', 'ROC', 'Taiwan', 'China', 'the Cold War', 'Korean War', 'the United States', 'ROC', 'the United Nations', '1971', 'ROC', 'Mongolia', '1961', 'The United Kingdom', 'France', 'United States', 'China', 'PRC', 'Albania', 'annual', 'ROC', 'PRC', 'General Assembly Resolution', 'Sino', 'Vietnam War', 'United States', 'Richard Nixon', 'Communist', 'Mao', '1971', 'Henry Kissinger', 'Zhou Enlai', '25 October 1971', 'Albania', ""the People's Republic of China"", 'China', 'General Assembly Resolution 2758', 'communist', 'the Soviet Union', 'India', 'United States', 'the United Kingdom', 'France', 'PRC', '15 November 1971', 'Nixon', 'China', 'the next year', 'Sino-American', 'the Republic of China', ""the People's Republic of China"", 'the Republic of China', 'Chinese Taipei', 'the International Olympic Committee', 'The Republic of', '2007', 'European', 'the United States', 'UN', 'Office of Legal Affairs', 'Taiwan', 'China']","['ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE']"
149,1971,November,21,"Battle of Garibpur: Indian troops aided by the Mukti Bahini, Bengali guerrillas, defeat the army of Pakistan",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971,"The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was a military confrontation between India and Pakistan that occurred during the liberation war in East Pakistan from 3 December 1971 to the fall of Dacca (Dhaka) on 16 December 1971.  The war began with preemptive aerial strikes on 11 Indian air stations, which led to the commencement of hostilities with Pakistan and Indian entry into the war of independence in East Pakistan on the side of Bengali nationalist forces. Lasting just 13 days, it is one of the shortest wars in history.During the war, Indian and Pakistani militaries simultaneously clashed on the eastern and western fronts; the war ended after the Eastern Command of the Pakistan military signed the Instrument of Surrender on 16 December 1971 in Dhaka, marking the formation of East Pakistan as the new nation of Bangladesh. Officially, East Pakistan had earlier called for its secession from the unity of Pakistan on 26 March 1971. Approximately 90,000 to 93,000 Pakistani servicemen were taken prisoner by the Indian Army, which included 79,676 to 81,000 uniformed personnel of the Pakistan Armed Forces, including some Bengali soldiers who had remained loyal to Pakistan.

150,1971,February,9,Probably 1st gay theme TV episode - All in the Family,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men,"Mad Men  is an American period drama television series created by Matthew Weiner and produced by Lionsgate Television. The series ran on the cable network AMC from 2007 to 2015, lasting for seven seasons and 92 episodes. Its fictional time frame runs from March 1960 to November 1970.
Mad Men is set initially at the fictional Sterling Cooper advertising agency on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, and later at the newly created firm of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce (later named Sterling Cooper & Partners), located near the Time-Life Building at 1271 Sixth Avenue. According to the pilot episode, the phrase ""Mad men"" was a slang term coined in the 1950s by advertisers working on Madison Avenue to refer to themselves, ""Mad"" being short for ""Madison"". (In reality, the only documented use of the phrase prior to the series may have been in the late-1950s writings of James Kelly, an advertising executive and writer.)The series' main character is the womanizing advertising executive Don Draper (played by Jon Hamm), who is initially the talented creative director at Sterling Cooper, and later a founding partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. The plot tracks the people in his personal and professional lives. As the series progresses, it depicts the changing moods and social mores of the United States throughout the 1960s.
Mad Men won widespread critical acclaim for its writing, acting, directing, visual style, and historical authenticity; it won many awards, including 16 Emmys and 5 Golden Globes. The show was also the first basic cable series to receive the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, winning the award each year of its first four seasons (2008–2011). It is widely regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time, and as part of the early 21st century Golden Age of Television.","{4736, 386, 3459, 3332, 2568, 524, 403, 3091, 5019, 2721, 290, 2210, 4642, 4899, 1319, 1576, 5033, 3243, 1709, 1711, 3632, 4400, 690, 2483, 694, 4407, 826, 4671, 1600, 1985, 3524, 3781, 1990, 967, 4426, 4430, 4688, 595, 1235, 3413, 4307, 5080, 2525, 97, 2018, 2274, 2149, 3174, 3686, 1640, 4329, 4971, 748, 1133, 3951, 1395, 1780, 1272, 889, 3322, 2171, 4990}",62,"['American', 'Matthew Weiner', 'Lionsgate Television', 'AMC', '2007', '2015', 'seven seasons', 'March 1960 to November 1970', 'Mad Men', 'Sterling Cooper', 'Madison Avenue', 'Manhattan', 'New York City', 'Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce', 'Sterling Cooper & Partners', 'the Time-Life Building', '1271 Sixth Avenue', 'the 1950s', 'Madison Avenue', 'Madison', 'late-1950s', 'James Kelly', 'Don Draper', 'Jon Hamm', 'Sterling Cooper', 'Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce', 'the United States', 'the 1960s', 'Emmys', 'Golden Globes', 'the Emmy Award', 'Outstanding Drama Series', 'each year', 'the early 21st century']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE']"

It employs disturbing, violent images to comment on psychiatry, juvenile delinquency, youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian near-future Britain.
Alex (Malcolm McDowell), the central character, is a charismatic, antisocial delinquent whose interests include classical music (especially Beethoven), committing rape, theft and what is termed ""ultra-violence"". He leads a small gang of thugs, Pete (Michael Tarn), Georgie (James Marcus), and Dim (Warren Clarke), whom he calls his droogs (from the Russian word друг, ""friend"", ""buddy""). The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, his capture, and attempted rehabilitation via an experimental psychological conditioning technique (the ""Ludovico Technique"") promoted by the Minister of the Interior (Anthony Sharp). Alex narrates most of the film in Nadsat, a fractured adolescent slang composed of Slavic (especially Russian), English, and Cockney rhyming slang.
The soundtrack to A Clockwork Orange features mostly classical music selections and Moog synthesizer compositions by Wendy Carlos. The artwork for the poster of A Clockwork Orange was created by Philip Castle with the layout by designer Bill Gold.","{4993, 4994, 515, 3459, 3978, 1041, 154, 4895, 159, 1058, 936, 3371, 176, 1584, 4785, 563, 2104, 1979, 703, 3777, 452, 580, 964, 583, 2508, 1997, 2004, 4438, 4829, 4967, 2152, 4330, 3443, 4472, 889, 3322, 890}",37,"[""Stanley Kubrick's"", 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Anthony Burgess', 'Malcolm McDowell', 'Clockwork Orange', '1971', 'Stanley Kubrick', ""Anthony Burgess's"", 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Britain', 'Alex', 'Malcolm McDowell', 'Beethoven', 'Pete', 'Michael Tarn', 'Georgie', 'James Marcus', 'Dim', 'Warren Clarke', 'Russian', 'the Minister of the Interior', 'Anthony Sharp', 'Alex', 'Nadsat', 'Slavic', 'Russian', 'English', 'Cockney', 'Moog', 'Wendy Carlos', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Philip Castle', 'Bill Gold']","['PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'LANGUAGE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON']"

It was composed by the band's guitarist Jimmy Page and vocalist Robert Plant for their untitled fourth studio album (often called Led Zeppelin IV). The song is sometimes regarded as the most popular rock tune of all time.The song has three sections, each one progressively increasing in tempo and volume. The song begins in a slow tempo with acoustic instruments (guitar and recorders) before introducing electric instruments. The final section is an uptempo hard rock arrangement highlighted by Page's intricate guitar solo (considered by many to be one of the greatest ever) accompanying Plant's vocals that end with the plaintive a cappella line: ""And she's buying a stairway to heaven.""
""Stairway to Heaven"" was voted number three in 2000 by VH1 on its list of the 100 Greatest Rock Songs, and was placed at number 31 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Orr used his ice skating speed, scoring, and play-making abilities to revolutionize the position of defenceman.  He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 12 seasons, starting with 10 with the Boston Bruins followed by two with the Chicago Black Hawks. Orr remains the only defenceman to have won the league scoring title with two Art Ross Trophies. He holds the record for most points and assists in a single season by a defenceman. Orr won a record eight consecutive Norris Trophies as the NHL's best defenceman and three consecutive Hart Trophies as the league's most valuable player (MVP). Orr was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1979 at age 31, the youngest to be inducted at that time. In 2017 Orr was named by the National Hockey League as one of the ""100 Greatest NHL Players"" in history. After his hockey career, he became a well-known scout for many professional teams. He also spends time talking to and mentoring young skaters.
Orr started in organized hockey at age eight. He first played as a forward but moved to defence and was encouraged to use his skating skills to control play. Orr's play in Ontario provincial competition attracted the notice of NHL scouts as early as age twelve. At fourteen, Orr joined the Oshawa Generals, the Bruins' junior hockey affiliate, and he was an all-star for three of his four seasons.
In 1966, Orr joined the Boston Bruins, a team that had not won a Stanley Cup since 1941 and had not qualified for the playoffs since 1959. With Orr, the Bruins won the Stanley Cup twice, in 1970 and 1972, and lost in the 1974 Final. In both victories, Orr scored the clinching goal and was named the playoff MVP. In the final achievement of his career, he was the MVP of the 1976 Canada Cup international hockey tournament. In 1976, Orr left Boston as a free agent to join the Black Hawks, but repeated injuries had effectively destroyed his left knee, and he retired in 1978 at age 30.
Orr's first professional contract was one of the first in professional ice hockey to be negotiated by an agent. It made him the highest-paid player in NHL history as a rookie. His second contract was the first million-dollar contract in the NHL. However, after his retirement, Orr learned he was deeply in debt and he had to sell off most of what he owned. Orr broke with his agent Alan Eagleson and sued the Black Hawks to settle his contract. Orr and his family returned to Boston where Orr went into business to rebuild his finances. Orr aided the investigations that led to Eagleson's fraud convictions and disbarment. Orr also supported the lawsuit that exposed the corruption of the NHL's pension plan.
Orr entered the player agent business in 1996 and today is president of the Orr Hockey Group agency. The agency represents over 20 active NHL players.

164,1971,January,11,"1st ""Quickie"" Divorce granted in UK",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(entertainer),"Madonna Louise Ciccone (; Italian: [tʃikˈkoːne]; born August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Referred to as the ""Queen of Pop"" since the 1980s, Madonna is known for pushing the boundaries of songwriting in popular music and for the visuals she uses onstage and in music videos. She has frequently reinvented her music and image while remaining completely in charge of every aspect of her career. Her diverse works, which incorporated social, political, sexual, and religious themes, have generated both critical acclaim and controversy. Madonna is often cited as an influence by other artists.
Born and raised in Michigan, Madonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy, Madonna signed with Sire Records in 1982 and released her eponymous debut album the next year. She followed it with a series of successful albums, including global bestsellers Like a Virgin (1984) and True Blue (1986) as well as Grammy Award winners Ray of Light (1998) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). Madonna has attained many number-one singles throughout her career, including ""Like a Virgin"", ""La Isla Bonita"", ""Like a Prayer"", ""Vogue"", ""Take a Bow"", ""Frozen"", ""Music"", ""Hung Up"", and ""4 Minutes"".
Madonna's popularity was further enhanced by her roles in films such as Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Dick Tracy (1990), A League of Their Own (1992), and Evita (1996). While Evita earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, many of her other films received poor reviews. As a businesswoman, Madonna founded an entertainment company called Maverick (including the label Maverick Records) in 1992. Her other ventures include fashion design, children's books, health clubs, and filmmaking. She contributes to various charities, having founded Ray of Light Foundation in 1998 and Raising Malawi in 2006.
Having sold more than 300 million records worldwide, Madonna is certified as the best-selling female recording artist of all time by Guinness World Records. According to Billboard, Madonna is the most successful solo artist in its Hot 100 chart history. She holds the record for the most number-one singles by a female artist in Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. She remains the highest-grossing solo touring artist of all time, accumulating U.S. $1.4 billion from her concert tickets. Madonna was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, her first year of eligibility.

167,1972,February,9,British government declares state of emergency after month-long coal miners' strike,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_miners%27_strike_(1984%E2%80%9385),"The miners' strike of 1984–85 was a major industrial action to shut down the British coal industry in an attempt to prevent colliery closures. It was led by Arthur Scargill of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) against the National Coal Board (NCB), a government agency. Opposition to the strike was led by the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who wanted to reduce the power of the trade unions.
The NUM was divided over the action and many mineworkers, especially in the Midlands, worked through the dispute. Few major trade unions supported the NUM, primarily because of the absence of a vote at national level. Violent confrontations between flying pickets and police characterised the year-long strike, which ended in a decisive victory for the Conservative government and allowed the closure of most of Britain's collieries. It was ""the most bitter industrial dispute in British history"".  The number of person-days of work lost to the strike was over 26 million, making it the largest since the 1926 general strike. The journalist Seumas Milne said of the strike, ""it has no real parallel – in size, duration and impact – anywhere in the world"".The NCB was encouraged to gear itself towards reduced subsidies in the early 1980s. After a strike was narrowly averted in February 1981, pit closures and pay restraint led to unofficial strikes. The main strike started on 6 March 1984 with a walkout at Cortonwood Colliery, which led to the NUM's Yorkshire Area's sanctioning of a strike on the grounds of a ballot result from 1981 in the Yorkshire Area, which was later challenged in court. The NUM President, Arthur Scargill, made the strike official across Britain on 12 March 1984, but the lack of a national ballot beforehand caused controversy. The NUM strategy was to cause a severe energy shortage of the sort that had won victory in the 1972 strike. The government strategy, designed by Margaret Thatcher, was threefold: to build up ample coal stocks, to keep as many miners at work as possible, and to use police to break up attacks by pickets on working miners. The critical element was the NUM's failure to hold a national strike ballot.The strike was ruled illegal in September 1984, as no national ballot had been held. It ended on 3 March 1985. It was a defining moment in British industrial relations, the NUM's defeat significantly weakening the trade union movement. It was a major victory for Thatcher and the Conservative Party, with the Thatcher government able to consolidate their economic programme. The number of strikes fell sharply in 1985 as a result of the ""demonstration effect"" and trade union power in general diminished. Three deaths resulted from events related to the strike.
The much-reduced coal industry was privatised in December 1994, ultimately becoming UK Coal. In 1983, Britain had 174 working pits, but by 2009 there were only six. Poverty increased in former coal mining areas, and in 1994 Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire was the poorest settlement in the country.","{3842, 3459, 3332, 4871, 3722, 2955, 3979, 3091, 2964, 663, 1192, 3243, 1709, 4526, 4661, 2487, 4536, 1979, 3005, 576, 1730, 4675, 452, 580, 1732, 3524, 3272, 3322, 843, 2767, 4307, 2004, 2388, 2901, 2647, 3413, 4563, 3676, 1757, 1502, 990, 1633, 1251, 3046, 2026, 4330, 4971, 3054, 1905, 1526, 4472, 889, 3578, 4605}",54,"['British', 'month-long', '1984–85', 'British', 'Arthur Scargill', 'the National Union of Mineworkers', 'NUM', 'the National Coal Board', 'Conservative', 'Margaret Thatcher', 'NUM', 'Midlands', 'NUM', 'year-long', 'Britain', 'British', 'person-days', '1926', 'Seumas Milne', 'world""', 'NCB', 'the early 1980s', 'February 1981', '6 March 1984', 'Cortonwood Colliery', 'NUM', ""Yorkshire Area's"", '1981', 'the Yorkshire Area', 'NUM', 'Arthur Scargill', 'Britain', '12 March 1984', 'NUM', '1972', 'Margaret Thatcher', 'NUM', 'September 1984', '3 March 1985', 'British', 'NUM', 'Thatcher', 'the Conservative Party', 'Thatcher', '1985', 'December 1994', 'UK', '1983', 'Britain', '2009', '1994', 'South Yorkshire']","['NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE']"
168,1972,February,17,British Parliament votes to join the European Common Market,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,"The United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, also known variously as the Referendum on the European Community (Common Market), the Common Market referendum and EEC membership referendum, took place under the provisions of the Referendum Act 1975 on 5 June 1975 in the United Kingdom to gauge support for the country's continued membership of the European Communities (EC) — often known at the time as the European Community and the Common Market — which it had entered two and a half years earlier on 1 January 1973 under the Conservative government of Edward Heath. The Labour Party's manifesto for the October 1974 general election had promised that the people would decide through the ballot box whether to remain in the EC.This was the first national referendum ever to be held throughout the United Kingdom, and would remain the only UK-wide referendum until the 2011 referendum on the Alternative Vote system was held thirty-six years later. It was also the only referendum to be held on the UK's relationship with Europe until the 2016 referendum on continued EU membership.
The electorate expressed significant support for EC membership, with 67% in favour on a national turnout of 64%. The referendum result was not legally binding; however, it was widely accepted that the vote would be politically binding on all future Westminster Parliaments. (However, eight years later, Labour's 1983 general election manifesto pledged withdrawal from the community.) In a 1975 pamphlet Prime Minister Harold Wilson said: ""I ask you to use your vote. For it is your vote that will now decide. The Government will accept your verdict."" The pamphlet also said: ""Now the time has come for you to decide. The Government will accept your decision — whichever way it goes.""
The February 1974 general election had yielded a Labour minority government, which then won a majority in the October 1974 general election. Labour pledged in its February 1974 manifesto to renegotiate the terms of British accession to the EC, and then to consult the public on whether Britain should stay in the EC on the new terms, if they were acceptable to the government. The Labour Party had historically feared the consequences of EC membership, such as the large differentials between the high price of food under the Common Agricultural Policy and the low prices prevalent in Commonwealth markets, as well as the loss of both economic sovereignty and the freedom of governments to engage in socialist industrial policies, and party leaders stated their opinion that the Conservatives had negotiated unfavourable terms for Britain. The EC heads of government agreed to a deal in Dublin on 11 March 1975; Wilson declared: ""I believe that our renegotiation objectives have been substantially though not completely achieved"", and said that the government would recommend a vote in favour of continued membership. On 9 April the House of Commons voted by 396 to 170 to continue within the Common Market on the new terms. Along with these developments, the government drafted a Referendum Bill, to be moved in case of a successful renegotiation.
The referendum debate and campaign was an unusual time in British politics and was the third national vote to be held in seventeen months. During the campaign, the Labour Cabinet was split and its members campaigned on each side of the question, an unprecedented breach of Cabinet collective responsibility. Most votes in the House of Commons in preparation for the referendum were only carried after opposition support, and the Government faced several defeats on technical issues such as the handling and format of the referendum counts.","{4097, 2051, 7, 2568, 524, 2063, 4113, 3090, 1555, 1566, 4641, 1058, 548, 4134, 561, 1077, 2101, 4661, 2104, 2621, 2116, 1095, 2119, 4682, 3154, 595, 3666, 1622, 2649, 2141, 2152, 1646, 1136, 1649, 4722, 2169, 2682, 2170, 2171, 127, 640, 4235, 3724, 1678, 2190, 2191, 2703, 3727, 4758, 4760, 1177, 666, 4768, 2210, 2215, 3243, 174, 4785, 182, 699, 3777, 1736, 1739, 1228, 1742, 3795, 4307, 3799, 3803, 4829, 2272, 3812, 3813, 1767, 4330, 1261, 3322, 3834, 3842, 1294, 4879, 3344, 2322, 3348, 3862, 3869, 4895, 290, 1827, 3874, 3365, 294, 1832, 4905, 815, 311, 1847, 2875, 4924, 4413, 2375, 2379, 2891, 4940, 4430, 2388, 3413, 4445, 1888, 1890, 873, 4971, 1388, 3952, 4472, 889, 4474, 3451, 892, 4993, 3970, 387, 3459, 4994, 2955, 3468, 3979, 3989, 1432, 2475, 4014, 4526, 2483, 4020, 4024, 4536, 4539, 1475, 452, 964, 3524, 4549, 5065, 971, 1483, 2507, 4051, 2004, 981, 4563, 5077, 5079, 3046, 4589, 4078, 2036, 3578, 4605}",158,"['British Parliament', 'European', 'The United Kingdom European Communities', 'Referendum', 'the European Community', 'EEC', 'the Referendum Act 1975', '5 June 1975', 'the United Kingdom', 'the European Communities', 'EC', 'the European Community', 'two and a half years earlier', '1 January 1973', 'Conservative', 'Edward Heath', ""The Labour Party's"", 'October 1974', 'the United Kingdom', 'UK', '2011', 'thirty-six years later', 'UK', 'Europe', '2016', 'EU', 'EC', '67%', '64%', 'Westminster Parliaments', 'eight years later', 'Labour', '1983', '1975', 'Harold Wilson', 'February 1974', 'October 1974', 'February 1974', 'British', 'EC', 'Britain', 'EC', 'The Labour Party', 'EC', 'the Common Agricultural Policy', 'Commonwealth', 'Conservatives', 'Britain', 'EC', 'Dublin', '11 March 1975', 'Wilson', '9 April', 'the House of Commons', 'British', 'seventeen months', 'the Labour Cabinet', 'Cabinet', 'the House of Commons']","['ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERCENT', 'PERCENT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG']"
169,1972,February,21,"Richard Nixon becomes the first US President to visit China, normalizing relations between the countries in a meeting with Chinese leader Mao Zedong in Beijing",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon%27s_1972_visit_to_China,"U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to the People's Republic of China was an important strategic and diplomatic overture that marked the culmination of the Nixon administration's resumption of harmonious relations between the United States and mainland China after years of diplomatic isolation. The seven-day official visit to three Chinese cities was the first time a U.S. president had visited the PRC; Nixon's arrival in Beijing ended 25 years of no communication or diplomatic ties between the two countries and was the key step in normalizing relations between the U.S. and China. Nixon visited China to gain more leverage over relations with the Soviet Union.
When the communists took over mainland China in 1949 and the nationalists fled to the island of Taiwan, the United States allied with, and recognized, the Republic of China as the sole government of China. Before his election as president in 1968, former Vice President Richard Nixon hinted at establishing a new relationship with the PRC. Early in his first term, Nixon, through his National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, sent subtle overtures hinting at warmer relations to the PRC government. After a series of these overtures by both countries, Kissinger flew on secret diplomatic missions to Beijing in 1971, where he met with Premier Zhou Enlai. On July 15, 1971, the President shocked the world by announcing on live television that he would visit the PRC the following year.
The week-long visit, from February 21 to 28, 1972, allowed the American public to view images of China for the first time in over two decades. Throughout the week the President and his senior advisers engaged in substantive discussions with the PRC leadership, including a meeting with Chairman Mao Zedong, while First Lady Pat Nixon toured schools, factories and hospitals in the cities of Beijing, Hangzhou and Shanghai with the large American press corps in tow.
Nixon dubbed his visit ""the week that changed the world"", a descriptor that continues to echo in the political lexicon. Repercussions of the Nixon visit continue to this day; while near-immediate results included a significant shift in the Cold War balance—driving a wedge between the Soviet Union and China, resulting in significant Soviet concessions to the U.S.—the trip spawned China's opening to the world and economic parity with capitalist countries.
The relationship between China and the U.S. is now one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world, and every successive U.S. president, except Jimmy Carter, has visited China. The trip is consistently ranked by historians, scholars, and journalists as one of the most important—if not the most important—visits by a U.S. president anywhere. Also, a ""Nixon to China"" moment has since become a metaphor for an unexpected, uncharacteristic or overly impactful action by a politician.","{4611, 2051, 1540, 7, 2568, 521, 524, 3598, 528, 3601, 3090, 1555, 4113, 1562, 28, 2589, 2078, 2079, 4642, 3109, 4134, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4647, 1583, 1584, 4661, 2104, 1081, 4671, 576, 2628, 4682, 75, 4174, 4688, 595, 1622, 2647, 3158, 2649, 3163, 2141, 4192, 2152, 619, 620, 2155, 1646, 2157, 1136, 1649, 3692, 1651, 3693, 3702, 2679, 3705, 2682, 2169, 2170, 3195, 127, 640, 1153, 2176, 1162, 3724, 1678, 2703, 144, 3727, 1170, 1683, 661, 4758, 1177, 154, 157, 159, 4768, 1185, 2210, 2213, 4775, 1192, 1193, 174, 1710, 4785, 3252, 698, 4286, 4799, 199, 2760, 1739, 2764, 717, 3277, 3795, 4307, 3285, 3799, 4313, 3803, 3804, 3805, 4829, 3808, 1251, 3812, 3813, 3303, 2793, 4330, 748, 239, 1780, 1783, 3322, 1275, 1276, 4859, 3842, 1795, 1288, 1800, 1291, 1292, 1803, 4367, 1808, 273, 3348, 3862, 795, 3869, 4895, 290, 3874, 294, 1319, 2342, 4905, 810, 812, 302, 4400, 4916, 311, 1847, 4920, 826, 2875, 3903, 2368, 3908, 843, 1867, 2379, 2891, 4430, 4942, 1873, 2899, 2388, 2901, 4437, 3927, 1370, 2908, 352, 1888, 1890, 355, 3936, 870, 873, 3434, 4971, 1388, 2415, 1907, 4472, 889, 4986, 3451, 892, 4993, 3970, 387, 2435, 3459, 4994, 1931, 2955, 3979, 4496, 2964, 3476, 3989, 1432, 3481, 3482, 3994, 3999, 3489, 418, 4007, 1960, 2984, 5033, 2475, 5037, 4014, 4526, 2483, 4020, 4024, 1979, 4539, 961, 1985, 5059, 452, 964, 1990, 3524, 4549, 2507, 2508, 1997, 1486, 463, 4558, 4051, 5077, 5079, 3034, 1502, 3040, 1508, 997, 2026, 4074, 492, 4589, 495, 5106, 5107, 1526, 2039, 2040, 1017, 3578, 4605}",259,"['Richard Nixon', 'US', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Mao Zedong', 'Beijing', 'U.S.', 'Richard Nixon', '1972', ""the People's Republic of China"", 'Nixon', 'the United States', 'China', 'years', 'seven-day', 'Chinese', 'U.S.', 'PRC', 'Nixon', 'Beijing', '25 years', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Nixon', 'China', 'the Soviet Union', 'China', '1949', 'Taiwan', 'the United States', 'the Republic of China', 'China', '1968', 'Richard Nixon', 'PRC', 'Nixon', 'Henry Kissinger', 'PRC', 'Kissinger', 'Beijing', '1971', 'Zhou Enlai', 'July 15, 1971', 'PRC', 'the following year', 'week-long', 'February 21 to 28, 1972', 'American', 'China', 'over two decades', 'the week', 'PRC', 'Mao Zedong', 'Pat Nixon', 'Beijing', 'Hangzhou', 'Shanghai', 'American', 'Nixon', 'the week', 'Nixon', 'this day', 'Cold War', 'the Soviet Union', 'China', 'Soviet', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Jimmy Carter', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Nixon', 'China']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE']"

It was abolished under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973.
The Parliament of Northern Ireland was bicameral, consisting of a House of Commons with 52 seats, and an indirectly elected Senate with 26 seats.

173,1972,June,23,"Hurricane Agnes becomes America's costliest natural disaster, effecting 15 states, with 119 deaths and $3 billion in damage",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Diane,"Hurricane Diane was the costliest Atlantic hurricane of its time, causing $813.7 million in damage. The inclusion of loss of business and personal revenue increased the total to over $1 billion. One of three hurricanes to hit North Carolina during the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed on August 7 from a tropical wave between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. Diane initially moved west-northwestward with little change in its intensity, but began to strengthen rapidly after turning to the north-northeast. On August 12, the hurricane reached peak sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. Gradually weakening after veering back west, Diane made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, as a strong tropical storm on August 17, just five days after Hurricane Connie struck near the same area. Diane weakened further after moving inland, at which point the United States Weather Bureau noted a decreased threat of further destruction. The storm turned to the northeast, and warm waters from the Atlantic Ocean helped produce record rainfall across the northeastern United States. On August 19, Diane emerged into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City, becoming extratropical two days later and completely dissipating by August 23.
The first area affected by Diane was North Carolina, which suffered coastal flooding but little wind and rain damage. After the storm weakened in Virginia, it maintained an area of moisture that resulted in heavy rainfall after interacting with the Blue Ridge Mountains, a process known as orographic lift. Flooding affected roads and low-lying areas along the Potomac River. The northernmost portion of Delaware also saw freshwater flooding, although to a much lesser extent than adjacent states. Diane produced heavy rainfall in eastern Pennsylvania, causing the worst floods on record there, largely in the Poconos and along the Delaware River. Rushing waters demolished about 150 road and rail bridges and breached or destroyed 30 dams. The swollen Brodhead Creek virtually submerged a summer camp, killing 37 people. Throughout Pennsylvania, the disaster killed 101 people and caused an estimated $70 million in damage (1955 USD). Additional flooding spread through the northwest portion of neighboring New Jersey, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate and destroying several bridges, including one built in 1831. Storm damage was evident but less significant in southeastern New York.
Damage from Diane was heaviest in Connecticut, where rainfall peaked at 16.86 in (428 mm) near Torrington. The storm produced the state's largest flood on record, which effectively split the state into two by destroying bridges and cutting communications. All major streams and valleys were flooded, and 30 stream gauges reported their highest levels on record. The Connecticut River at Hartford reached a water level of 30.6 ft (9.3 m), the third highest on record there. The flooding destroyed a large section of downtown Winsted, much of which was never rebuilt. Record-high tides and flooded rivers heavily damaged Woonsocket, Rhode Island. In Massachusetts, flood water levels surpassed those during the 1938 Long Island hurricane, breaching multiple dams and inundating adjacent towns and roads. Throughout New England, 206 dams were damaged or destroyed, and about 7,000 people were injured. Nationwide, Diane killed at least 184 people and destroyed 813 houses, with another 14,000 homes heavily damaged. In the hurricane's wake, eight states were declared federal disaster areas, and the name Diane was retired.",set(),0,"['Hurricane Agnes', 'America', 'Hurricane Diane', 'Atlantic', 'North Carolina', 'the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season', 'August 7', 'Cape Verde', 'Diane', 'August 12', 'Category 2', 'Diane', 'Wilmington', 'North Carolina', 'August 17', 'just five days', 'Hurricane Connie', 'Diane', 'the United States Weather Bureau', 'the Atlantic Ocean', 'United States', 'August 19', 'Diane', 'the Atlantic Ocean', 'New York City', 'two days later', 'August 23', 'Diane', 'North Carolina', 'Virginia', 'the Blue Ridge Mountains', 'the Potomac River', 'Delaware', 'Diane', 'Pennsylvania', 'Poconos', 'the Delaware River', 'Brodhead Creek', 'summer', 'Pennsylvania', 'New Jersey', '1831', 'New York', 'Diane', 'Connecticut', 'Torrington', 'The Connecticut River', 'Hartford', 'Woonsocket', 'Rhode Island', 'Massachusetts', '1938', 'Long Island', 'New England', 'Diane', 'Diane']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON']"

Under the terms of the treaty, each party was limited to two ABM complexes, each of which was to be limited to 100 anti-ballistic missiles.Signed in 1972, it was in force for the next 30 years.

In the traditional manner of musical theater, called an ""integrated musical"", every significant character in the stage version sings to express his or her own emotion and to advance the plot. In the film version, the musical numbers are entirely diegetic.:609 All of them take place inside the club,:609 with one exception: ""Tomorrow Belongs to Me"", the only song sung neither by Grey's character of the Kit Kat Klub's Master of Ceremonies nor by Minnelli's character of Sally Bowles.After the box office failure of his film version of Sweet Charity in 1969, Bob Fosse bounced back with Cabaret in 1972, a year that made him the most honored director in the movie business. The film also brought Liza Minnelli, the daughter of Judy Garland and Vincente Minnelli, her own first chance to sing on screen, and she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. With Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor (Joel Grey), Best Director (Bob Fosse), Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Sound, Best Original Song Score and Adaptation, and Best Film Editing, Cabaret holds the record for most Oscars earned by a film not honored for Best Picture. It is listed as number 367 on Empire’s 500 greatest films of all time. Cabaret opened to glowing reviews and strong box office, eventually taking in more than $20 million. In addition to its eight Oscars, it won Best Picture citations from the National Board of Review and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, and took Best Supporting Actor honors for Grey from the National Board of Review, the Hollywood Foreign Press, and the National Society of Film Critics. In 1995, Cabaret was the ninth live-action musical film selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".","{1025, 1026, 1539, 515, 2051, 4611, 7, 519, 2568, 3601, 3091, 3098, 2590, 3109, 38, 4134, 1576, 561, 4661, 4154, 574, 4671, 4675, 70, 582, 583, 584, 4174, 595, 88, 1114, 2141, 3678, 1121, 3686, 1128, 3693, 2169, 2171, 637, 1672, 4235, 2702, 2704, 1686, 1177, 154, 4763, 3228, 157, 4768, 3243, 3244, 1709, 1711, 176, 4785, 690, 2226, 2741, 2743, 703, 2753, 3778, 708, 2245, 198, 1222, 1228, 717, 4307, 4829, 3811, 3814, 744, 748, 4845, 3823, 1272, 3833, 3322, 3834, 3842, 1795, 1804, 269, 782, 272, 290, 1319, 1831, 1834, 3882, 813, 815, 4400, 2355, 1847, 4407, 826, 4413, 831, 324, 2375, 4426, 4942, 336, 1360, 4944, 2388, 2901, 3413, 4437, 4445, 3934, 4967, 1898, 4971, 3439, 889, 3451, 4990, 4480, 3459, 900, 1924, 3463, 4487, 3978, 2955, 3979, 1938, 5010, 2964, 3989, 1432, 3481, 2458, 411, 1437, 3998, 3490, 4007, 5033, 4526, 2483, 948, 2997, 1462, 1464, 4024, 1979, 1475, 3524, 2507, 2508, 4558, 463, 2000, 4563, 2004, 3542, 471, 3545, 1502, 2531, 5097, 3564, 4589, 1010, 5107, 3578, 4605}",173,"['Cabaret', 'Bob Fosse', 'Liza Minnelli', 'Michael York', 'Cabaret', '1972', 'American', 'Bob Fosse', 'Liza Minnelli', 'Michael York', 'Joel Grey', 'Berlin', 'the Weimar Republic', '1931', 'Nazi Party', '1966', 'Broadway', 'Cabaret', 'Kander and Ebb', ""Christopher Isherwood's"", 'The Berlin Stories', '1945', '1951', 'I Am a Camera', 'work.:609', 'Kander', 'Ebb', 'Tomorrow Belongs to Me', 'Grey', ""Kat Klub's"", 'Minnelli', 'Sally Bowles', 'Sweet Charity', '1969', 'Bob Fosse', 'Cabaret', '1972', 'a year', 'Liza Minnelli', 'Judy Garland', 'Vincente Minnelli', 'the Academy Award for Best Actress', 'Joel Grey', 'Bob Fosse', 'Best Cinematography', 'Adaptation', 'Cabaret', 'Oscars', 'Empire', 'Cabaret', 'Oscars', 'the National Board of Review', 'the Hollywood Foreign Press Association', 'Grey', 'the National Board of Review', 'the Hollywood Foreign Press', 'the National Society of Film Critics', '1995', 'Cabaret', 'Congress', 'the United States National Film Registry']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG']"

177,1972,September,17,"TV comedy M*A*S*H, adapted from the movie, starring Alan Alda, Loretta Swit and Wayne Rogers debuts on CBS in the US",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh,"The Macintosh (mainly Mac since 1998) is a family of personal computers designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Inc. since January 1984.
The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface, built-in screen, and mouse. Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until the latter was discontinued in 1993.
Early Macintosh models were expensive, hindering competitiveness in a market dominated by the much cheaper Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses. Although they were less expensive than the Xerox Alto and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac. Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing, making Apple the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade. In the early 1990s, Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-competitive with Wintel machines at the time. However, the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel's Pentium processor which beat the Motorola 68040 in most benchmarks, gradually took market share from Apple, and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer. Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line in the mid-1990s, the falling prices of commodity PC components, poor inventory management with the Macintosh Performa, and the release of Windows 95 contributed to some decline of the Macintosh user base.
Upon his return, Steve Jobs led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models in mid-1997 (including models made for specific regions) down to four in mid-1999: the Power Macintosh G3, iMac, 14.1"" PowerBook G3, and 12"" iBook. All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high performance, competitive prices, and aesthetic designs, and helped return Apple to profitability. Around this time, Apple phased out the Macintosh name in favor of ""Mac"", a nickname that had been in common use since the development of the first model. Since their transition to Intel processors in 2006, the complete lineup is Intel-based. Its current lineup includes four desktops (the all-in-one iMac and iMac Pro, and the desktop Mac Mini and Mac Pro), and two laptops (the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro). Its Xserve server was discontinued in 2011 in favor of the Mac Mini and Mac Pro.
Apple has developed a series of Macintosh operating systems. The first versions initially had no name but came to be known as the ""Macintosh System Software"" in 1988, ""Mac OS"" in 1997 with the release of Mac OS 7.6, and retrospectively called ""Classic Mac OS"". Apple produced a Unix-based operating system for the Macintosh called A/UX from 1988 to 1995, which closely resembled contemporary versions of the Macintosh system software. Apple does not license macOS for use on non-Apple computers, however, System 7 was licensed to various companies through Apple's Macintosh clone program from 1995 to 1997. Only one company, UMAX Technologies was legally licensed to ship clones running Mac OS 8. In 2001, Apple released Mac OS X, a modern Unix-based operating system which was later rebranded to simply OS X in 2012, and then macOS in 2016. The current version is macOS Catalina, released on October 7, 2019. Intel-based Macs are capable of running native third party operating systems such as Linux, OpenBSD, and Microsoft Windows with the aid of Boot Camp or third-party software. Volunteer communities have customized Intel-based macOS to run illicitly on non-Apple computers.  Apple is rumored to be developing its own Apple-designed Arm processors for future Macintoshes.","{1026, 521, 528, 4113, 3090, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1566, 1058, 39, 1576, 3630, 1584, 2100, 4661, 1081, 2112, 3139, 580, 2628, 2652, 2141, 4192, 2152, 4718, 1136, 3186, 3195, 640, 2176, 131, 4235, 1677, 1678, 3727, 661, 154, 4768, 2210, 3243, 1709, 4785, 703, 3777, 3268, 4807, 717, 3795, 3803, 3804, 3805, 4829, 3813, 3303, 2798, 1783, 2297, 3322, 771, 3862, 3869, 4895, 1832, 2856, 4905, 4913, 309, 311, 2875, 1341, 3901, 4413, 1857, 2379, 2891, 4941, 4430, 2898, 3413, 1890, 1386, 3437, 2417, 1908, 889, 890, 892, 4990, 4991, 4994, 3460, 1929, 3979, 401, 4014, 4526, 4527, 2483, 1979, 5059, 452, 964, 3524, 5065, 5067, 2508, 1997, 2004, 5077, 5079, 3544, 3034, 478, 3040, 492, 2039, 511}",118,"['Alan Alda', 'Loretta Swit', 'Wayne Rogers', 'CBS', 'US', 'Macintosh', 'Mac', '1998', 'Apple Inc.', 'January 1984', 'Macintosh', 'Apple', 'Macintosh', 'Apple II', 'almost ten years', '1993', 'Macintosh', 'the IBM Personal Computer', 'the Xerox Alto', 'Mac', 'Macintosh', 'Apple', 'the next decade', 'the early 1990s', 'Apple', 'Color Classic', 'Wintel', 'Intel', 'Pentium', 'Motorola', 'Apple', 'the end of 1994', 'Apple', 'Compaq', 'Power Macintosh', 'the mid-1990s', 'the Macintosh Performa', 'Windows 95', 'Macintosh', 'Steve Jobs', 'Apple', 'Macintosh', 'mid-1997', 'mid-1999', 'the Power Macintosh G3', 'iMac', 'PowerBook G3', 'iBook', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Macintosh', 'Mac', 'Intel', '2006', 'Intel', 'iMac Pro', 'Mac Mini', 'Mac Pro', 'the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro', '2011', 'the Mac Mini', 'Mac Pro', 'Apple', 'Macintosh', 'the ""Macintosh System Software""', '1988', 'Mac OS', '1997', 'Mac OS 7.6', 'Classic Mac OS', 'Apple', 'Macintosh', '1988 to 1995', 'Macintosh', 'Apple', 'non-Apple', 'System 7', 'Apple', 'Macintosh', '1995 to 1997', 'UMAX Technologies', 'Mac OS 8', '2001', 'Apple', 'Mac OS X', '2012', '2016', 'Catalina', 'October 7, 2019', 'Intel', 'Macs', 'Linux', 'Microsoft', 'Windows', 'Boot Camp', 'Intel', 'macOS', 'non-Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Arm', 'Macintoshes']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'PERSON']"
178,1972,June,6,"David Bowie releases his breakthrough album ""The Rise & Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Ziggy_Stardust_and_the_Spiders_from_Mars,"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (often shortened to Ziggy Stardust) is the fifth studio album by English musician David Bowie, released on 16 June 1972 in the United Kingdom by RCA Records. It was produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and features contributions from Bowie's backing band the Spiders from Mars – comprising Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey. The album was recorded at Trident Studios in London like his previous album Hunky Dory. Most of the album was recorded in November 1971 with further sessions in January and early February 1972.
Described as a rock opera and also a loose concept album, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars is about Bowie's titular alter ego Ziggy Stardust, a fictional androgynous bisexual rock star who acts as a messenger for extraterrestrial beings. The album, and the character of Ziggy Stardust, were influenced by glam rock and explored themes of sexual exploration and social taboos. The character was retained for the subsequent Ziggy Stardust Tour through the United Kingdom, Japan and North America. A concert film of the same name, directed by D. A. Pennebaker, was recorded in 1973 and released a decade later.
Preceded by the single ""Starman"", The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars peaked at number five on the UK Albums Chart and number 75 in the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart. The album received widespread critical acclaim and propelled Bowie to stardom. It re-peaked at number 21 on the Billboard 200 in 2016 following Bowie's death. As of January 2016 it had sold 7.5 million copies worldwide. Rolling Stone ranked it 35th on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2017, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry, being deemed ""culturally, historically, or artistically significant"" by the Library of Congress.","{4101, 7, 2568, 521, 2078, 4642, 1573, 4134, 4647, 1576, 2096, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4174, 4688, 3154, 595, 1619, 3666, 1622, 3163, 607, 619, 2155, 3180, 3693, 1136, 1649, 4722, 2169, 2170, 2682, 2171, 640, 4224, 2703, 3727, 4758, 4768, 2721, 2210, 1699, 677, 167, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 3285, 4313, 3805, 3808, 3303, 4330, 748, 3322, 1275, 4859, 3842, 1795, 4879, 1808, 3869, 4895, 1828, 294, 807, 815, 4916, 310, 311, 4920, 2891, 4940, 4942, 2388, 3927, 1888, 4971, 3952, 3446, 4472, 889, 4474, 3451, 4990, 4993, 3970, 3459, 3460, 4994, 2955, 3979, 3989, 1432, 3994, 4014, 2995, 4024, 4539, 4549, 1990, 967, 5065, 971, 2507, 2508, 467, 4563, 5077, 5079, 987, 1502, 3040, 2018, 4589, 4078, 5106, 5107, 5117}",123,"['David Bowie', 'The Rise & Fall', 'Ziggy Stardust', 'Mars', 'Ziggy Stardust', 'Mars', 'Ziggy Stardust', 'English', 'David Bowie', '16 June 1972', 'the United Kingdom', 'RCA Records', 'Bowie', 'Ken Scott', 'Bowie', 'Mars', 'Mick Ronson', 'Trevor Bolder', 'Mick Woodmansey', 'Trident Studios', 'London', 'Hunky Dory', 'November 1971', 'January', 'early February 1972', 'The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust', 'Mars', 'Bowie', 'Ziggy Stardust', 'Ziggy Stardust', 'Ziggy Stardust Tour', 'the United Kingdom', 'Japan', 'North America', 'D.

He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums. John has sold more than 300 million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits in the UK Singles Chart and US Billboard Hot 100, including seven number ones in the UK and nine in the US, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the US. His tribute single ""Candle in the Wind 1997"", rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33 million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also produced records and occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford F.C. from 1976 to 1987 and from 1997 to 2002. He is an honorary life president of the club.
Raised in the Pinner area of Greater London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology, an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, Empty Sky, was released. In 1970, his first hit single, ""Your Song"", from his second album, Elton John, reached the top ten in the UK and the US. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for The Lion King and its stage adaptation, Aida and Billy Elliot the Musical.
John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 49th on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, Billboard ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists, and third overall, behind the Beatles and Madonna. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was knighted by Elizabeth II for ""services to music and charitable services"" in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012.
John has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and a year later he began hosting his annual Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the biggest high-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over £300 million. John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005; they married after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014. Presenting John with France's highest civilian award, the Legion d'honneur, in 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron called him a ""melodic genius"" and praised his work on behalf of the LGBT community. In 2018, John embarked on a three-year farewell tour.","{2051, 519, 521, 4113, 2589, 2078, 1058, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4140, 1584, 563, 4661, 2104, 2112, 66, 3139, 2628, 4675, 1622, 4192, 2152, 620, 1649, 2169, 127, 640, 1678, 2703, 144, 1168, 1170, 1177, 154, 1178, 4763, 160, 677, 2214, 3244, 174, 176, 1712, 4785, 3777, 1222, 1223, 4825, 3803, 3804, 3805, 4829, 3808, 3813, 3303, 3308, 3322, 1275, 4871, 1292, 1808, 4895, 3874, 294, 302, 2355, 310, 311, 2365, 3903, 1857, 2375, 4941, 4942, 3927, 3934, 1890, 3427, 1386, 1898, 3954, 3451, 4993, 4994, 900, 3463, 2955, 3468, 3979, 2964, 3989, 924, 2982, 5037, 4526, 2483, 4020, 4024, 4536, 5059, 452, 3524, 5067, 2508, 1997, 4563, 2004, 5079, 3046, 5107, 2040, 3578, 4605}",115,"['Honky Chateau', ""Elton John's"", 'US', 'Rocket Man', 'Elton Hercules', 'John', 'Reginald Kenneth Dwight', '25 March 1947', 'English', 'Bernie Taupin', '1967', 'John', 'UK', 'Singles Chart', 'US', 'UK', 'US', 'US', 'Candle in the Wind 1997', 'Diana', 'Wales', 'UK', 'US', 'John', 'F.C.', '1976', '1987', '1997', '2002', 'Pinner', 'Greater London', 'John', '1962', 'Bluesology', 'R&B', '1967', '1967', 'two years', 'Lulu', 'John', 'Hollies', '1969', 'John', 'Empty Sky', '1970', 'Your Song""', 'Elton John', 'UK', 'US', 'John', 'The Lion King', 'Aida', 'Billy Elliot', 'John', 'Grammy Awards', 'Brit Awards', 'Academy Awards', 'a Tony Award', 'the Kennedy Center Honor', '2004', 'Rolling Stone', '2013', 'Billboard', 'Beatles', 'Madonna', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame', '1994', 'the Songwriters Hall of Fame', '1992', 'the British Academy of Songwriters', 'Elizabeth II', '1998', 'John', 'Princess Diana at', '1997', 'Party', 'Palace', '2002', ""the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert"", 'Buckingham Palace', '2012', 'John', 'the late 1980s', '1992', 'the Elton John AIDS Foundation', 'a year later', 'annual', 'Academy Awards Party', 'Oscar', 'Hollywood', 'John', '1976', '1988', 'David Furnish', '21 December 2005', 'England', 'Wales', '2014', 'John', 'France', 'Legion', '2019', 'French', 'Emmanuel Macron', '2018', 'John', 'three-year']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"

184,1972,March,12,NHL great Gordie Howe retires after 26 seasons,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Howe,"Gordon Howe  (March 31, 1928 – June 10, 2016) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. From 1946 to 1980, he played twenty-six seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) and six seasons in the World Hockey Association (WHA); his first 25 seasons were spent with the Detroit Red Wings. Nicknamed ""Mr. Hockey"", Howe is often considered the most complete player to ever play the game and one of the greatest of all time. A 23-time NHL All-Star, he held many of the sport's career scoring records until they were broken in the 1980s by Wayne Gretzky, who himself has been a major champion of Howe's legacy. He continues to hold NHL records for most games and seasons played. In 2017, Howe was named one of the ""100 Greatest NHL Players"".Howe made his NHL debut with the Red Wings in 1946. He won the Art Ross Trophy for leading the league in points each year from 1950–51 to 1953–54, then again in 1956-57 and 1962–63, for a total of six times, which is the second most in NHL history. He led the NHL in goal scoring four times. He ranked among the top ten in NHL scoring for 21 consecutive years and set an NHL record for points in a season (95) in 1953, a record which was broken six years later. He won the Stanley Cup with the Red Wings four times and won six Hart Trophies as the NHL's most valuable player. He also led the NHL in playoff points six times.
Howe retired for the first time in 1971 and was immediately inducted into the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame that same year. He was then inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame the next year, but came back two years later to join his sons Mark and Marty on the Houston Aeros of the WHA. Although in his mid-40s, he scored over 100 points twice in six years, won two straight Avco World Trophies (1974 and 1975) and was named most valuable player in 1974. He made a brief return to the NHL in 1979–80, playing one season with the Hartford Whalers, then retired at age 52. His involvement with the WHA was central to their brief pre-NHL merger success, forcing the NHL to recruit European talent and expand to new markets.
Howe was most famous for his scoring prowess, physical strength and career longevity, and redefined the ideal qualities of a forward. He is the only player to have competed in the NHL in five different decades (1940s through 1980s). He became the namesake of the ""Gordie Howe hat trick"": a goal, an assist and a fight in the same game, though he only recorded two such games in his career. He was the inaugural recipient of the NHL Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008.","{1026, 1545, 3468, 3727, 2708, 1566, 4895, 1569, 3621, 1576, 4905, 3243, 2171, 5037, 4526, 4785, 4913, 2869, 4661, 1979, 3777, 964, 580, 1233, 212, 3413, 4829, 1374, 4192, 2658, 3813, 2152, 874, 2039, 3578, 2555, 892, 4991}",38,"['NHL', 'Gordie Howe', 'Gordon Howe', 'March 31, 1928', 'June 10, 2016', 'Canadian', '1946 to 1980', 'twenty-six seasons', 'the National Hockey League', 'NHL', 'six seasons', 'the World Hockey Association', 'WHA', 'his first 25 seasons', 'the Detroit Red Wings', 'Hockey', 'Howe', 'NHL', 'All-Star', 'the 1980s', 'Wayne Gretzky', 'Howe', 'NHL', '2017', 'Howe', 'NHL', 'the Red Wings', '1946', 'each year', '1956-57', '1962–63', 'NHL', 'NHL', 'NHL', '21 consecutive years', 'NHL', 'a season', '1953', 'six years later', 'the Stanley Cup', 'NHL', 'NHL', '1971', 'the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame', 'that same year', 'the Hockey Hall of Fame', 'the next year', 'two years later', 'Mark', 'Marty', 'the Houston Aeros', 'his mid-40s', 'six years', 'Avco World Trophies', '1974', '1975', '1974', 'NHL', '1979–80', 'one season', 'the Hartford Whalers', 'age 52', 'WHA', 'NHL', 'NHL', 'European', 'Howe', 'NHL', '1940s through 1980s', 'the ""Gordie Howe', '2008']","['ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE']"

187,1972,April,25,Comedic actor Bob Denver (37) weds third wife Carole Abrahams,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deaths_from_drug_overdose_and_intoxication,"Drug overdose and intoxication are significant causes of accidental death, and can also be used as a form of suicide. Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined drug intoxication (CDI) due to poly drug use. Poly drug use often carries more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. For example, the chance of death from overdosing on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol. While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses. Drug overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal traffic collisions.Drug use and overdoses increased significantly in the 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also increased significantly following the invention of the hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.Efforts to prohibit various drugs began to be enacted in the early 20th century, though the effectiveness of such policies is debated. Deaths from drug overdoses are increasing. Between 2000 and 2014, fatal overdoses rose 137% in the United States, causing nearly half a million deaths in that period, and have also been continually increasing in Australia, Scotland, England, and Wales. 
While prohibited drugs are generally viewed as being the most dangerous, the misuse of prescription drugs is linked to more deaths in several countries. Cocaine and heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. As of 2015, the drug most likely to cause fatal overdose in Australia was diazepam (Valium). While fatal overdoses are highly associated with drugs such as opiates, cocaine and alcohol, deaths from other drugs such as caffeine are extremely rare.This alphabetical list contains 607 notable people whose deaths can be reliably sourced to be the result of drug overdose or acute drug intoxication. Where sources indicate drug overdose or intoxication was only suspected to be the cause of death, this will be specified in the 'notes' column. Where sources are able to indicate, deaths are specified as 'suicide', 'accidental', 'undetermined', or otherwise in the 'cause' column. Where sources do not explicitly state intent, they will be listed in this column as 'unknown'. Deaths from accidents or misadventure caused by drug overdoses or intoxication are also included on this list. Deaths from long-term effects of drugs, such as tobacco-related cancers and cirrhosis from alcohol, are not included, nor are deaths from lethal injection or legal euthanasia.","{640, 4741, 1547, 3727, 2322, 4768, 4134, 2856, 4905, 5060, 4549, 968, 971, 2507, 4430, 4815, 595, 3795, 4824, 4825, 5080, 2171}",22,"['Bob Denver', '37', 'Carole Abrahams', 'CDI', 'marijuana', 'the 1800s', 'centuries', '1803', '1855', 'Western', '1853', 'the early 20th century', 'Between 2000 and 2014', '137%', 'the United States', 'Australia', 'Scotland', 'England', 'Wales', 'Cocaine', 'the United Kingdom', '2013', 'the United States', '2008', '2015', 'Australia']","['PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE']"

Born in Brantford, Ontario, Hartman and his family moved to the United States in 1958. After graduating from California State University, Northridge with a degree in graphic arts, he designed album covers for bands including Poco and America. Hartman joined the comedy group the Groundlings in 1975 and there helped comedian Paul Reubens develop his character Pee-wee Herman. Hartman co-wrote the film Pee-wee's Big Adventure and made recurring appearances as Captain Carl on Reubens's show Pee-wee's Playhouse.
In 1986, Hartman joined the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. He won fame for his impressions, particularly of President Bill Clinton, and stayed on the show for eight seasons. Nicknamed the ""Glue"" for his ability to hold the show together and help other cast members, Hartman won a Primetime Emmy Award for his SNL work in 1989. In 1995, after scrapping plans for his own variety show, he starred as Bill McNeal in the NBC sitcom NewsRadio. He voiced various roles on The Simpsons, most notably Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure. He also had roles in the films Houseguest, Sgt. Bilko, Jingle All the Way, Small Soldiers, and the English dub of Kiki's Delivery Service.
Hartman divorced twice before he married Brynn Omdahl in 1987, with whom he had two children. Their marriage was troubled by Brynn's drug use and Phil's constant absence from home. On May 28, 1998, Brynn shot and killed Hartman while he slept in their Encino, Los Angeles home, then died by suicide. In the weeks following his death, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly opined that Hartman was ""the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper ... a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with."" He was posthumously inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2012 and the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2014.","{519, 2568, 528, 3090, 4115, 3608, 2076, 1566, 1576, 4649, 2092, 4140, 565, 4661, 1600, 2112, 580, 2647, 2649, 3676, 1633, 612, 2152, 1133, 3702, 2171, 3727, 1170, 663, 154, 2718, 1192, 3243, 1711, 4785, 4287, 3777, 1742, 4829, 1251, 3813, 2793, 748, 1272, 3322, 1288, 1813, 4895, 3365, 295, 1319, 4905, 4400, 4913, 2875, 4924, 3908, 843, 1867, 1357, 4430, 4944, 2901, 3413, 4437, 1890, 355, 1898, 4971, 1403, 892, 4990, 4991, 903, 1929, 3979, 1938, 5010, 3482, 3999, 4516, 424, 4526, 1455, 2483, 2487, 2489, 1979, 5052, 452, 964, 3524, 4558, 5077, 4056, 5097, 2026, 1006, 2039, 3578}",100,"['Phil Hartman', 'Gretchen Lewis', '2 years', 'Philip Edward Hartmann', 'September 24, 1948', 'May 28, 1998', 'Canadian', 'American', 'Brantford', 'Ontario', 'Hartman', 'the United States', '1958', 'California State University', 'Northridge', 'Poco and America', 'Hartman', '1975', 'Paul Reubens', 'Pee-wee Herman', 'Hartman co-', ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"", 'Carl', 'Reubens', 'Playhouse', '1986', 'Hartman', 'Saturday Night Live', 'Bill Clinton', 'eight seasons', 'Hartman', 'Primetime', 'SNL', '1989', '1995', 'Bill McNeal', 'NBC', 'NewsRadio', 'Simpsons', 'Lionel Hutz', 'Troy McClure', 'Houseguest', 'Sgt', 'Bilko', 'English', ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", 'Hartman', 'Brynn Omdahl', '1987', 'Brynn', 'Phil', 'May 28, 1998', 'Brynn', 'Hartman', 'Encino', 'Los Angeles', 'the weeks', 'Hartman', 'Dan Snierson', 'Entertainment Weekly', 'Hartman', 'Canada', 'Walk of Fame', '2012', 'the Hollywood Walk of Fame', '2014']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LANGUAGE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE']"
190,1973,January,22,Roe vs Wade: US Supreme Court legalizes most abortions,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade,"Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protects a pregnant woman's liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction. It struck down many U.S. state and federal abortion laws, and prompted an ongoing national debate in the United States about whether and to what extent abortion should be legal, who should decide the legality of abortion, what methods the Supreme Court should use in constitutional adjudication, and what the role  of religious and moral views in the political sphere should be. Roe v. Wade reshaped U.S. politics, dividing much of the United States into abortion rights and anti-abortion movements, while activating grassroots movements on both sides.
The decision involved the case of a woman named Norma McCorvey—known in her lawsuit under the pseudonym ""Jane Roe""—who in 1969 became pregnant with her third child and wanted an abortion. However, McCorvey lived in Texas, where abortion was illegal except when necessary to save the mother's life. She was referred to lawyers Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, who filed a lawsuit on her behalf in U.S. federal court against her local district attorney, Henry Wade, alleging that Texas's abortion laws were unconstitutional. A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas heard the case and ruled in her favor. Texas then appealed this ruling directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.
In January 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides a ""right to privacy"" that protects a pregnant woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. However, it held that this right is not absolute, and must be balanced against the government's interests in protecting women's health and protecting prenatal life. The Court resolved this balancing test by tying state regulation of abortion to the three trimesters of pregnancy: during the first trimester, governments could not prohibit abortions at all; during the second trimester, governments could require reasonable health regulations; during the third trimester, abortions could be prohibited entirely so long as the laws contained exceptions for cases when they were necessary to save the life or health of the mother. The Court classified the right to choose to have an abortion as ""fundamental"", which required courts to evaluate challenged abortion laws under the ""strict scrutiny"" standard, the highest level of judicial review in the United States.Roe was criticized by some in the legal community, and some have called the decision a form of judicial activism. In a prominent Yale Law Journal article published soon after the decision was issued, the legal scholar John Hart Ely criticized Roe as a decision that ""is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be."" In 1992, the Supreme Court revisited and modified its legal rulings in Roe in the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In Casey, the Court reaffirmed Roe's holding that a woman's right to choose to have an abortion is constitutionally protected, but abandoned Roe's trimester framework in favor of a standard based on fetal viability, and overruled Roe's requirement that government regulations on abortion be subjected to the strict scrutiny standard.","{640, 3842, 4994, 7, 2955, 2703, 1168, 3727, 3989, 4768, 2169, 290, 4134, 1576, 1201, 4024, 2875, 452, 4549, 1222, 967, 3322, 971, 2507, 2509, 595, 4307, 5077, 1622, 3805, 4589, 1649, 889, 4474, 3451, 4605}",36,"['Roe vs Wade: US Supreme Court', 'Roe v.

191,1973,January,23,US President Richard Nixon announces an accord has been reached to end Vietnam War,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Richard_Nixon,"The presidency of Richard Nixon began at noon EST on January 20, 1969, when Richard Nixon was inaugurated as 37th President of the United States, and ended on August 9, 1974, when he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office, the only U.S. president ever to do so. He was succeeded by Gerald Ford, whom he had appointed Vice President after Spiro Agnew was forced to resign. Nixon took office after the 1968 presidential election, in which he defeated incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Although Nixon had built his reputation as a  very active Republican campaigner, he downplayed partisanship in his 1972 landslide reelection.
Nixon's primary focus while in office was on foreign affairs. He focused on détente with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, easing Cold War tensions with both countries. As part of this policy, Nixon signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and SALT I, two landmark arms control treaties with the Soviet Union. Nixon promulgated the Nixon Doctrine, which called for indirect assistance by the United States rather than direct U.S. commitments as seen in the ongoing Vietnam War. After extensive negotiations with North Vietnam, Nixon withdrew the last U.S. soldiers from South Vietnam in 1973, ending the military draft that same year. To prevent the possibility of further U.S. intervention in Vietnam, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution over Nixon's veto.
In domestic affairs, Nixon advocated a policy of ""New Federalism,"" in which federal powers and responsibilities would be shifted to the states. However, he faced a Democratic Congress that did not share his goals and, in some cases, enacted legislation over his veto. Nixon's proposed reform of federal welfare programs did not pass Congress, but Congress did adopt one aspect of his proposal in the form of Supplemental Security Income, which provides aid to low-income individuals who are aged or disabled. The Nixon administration adopted a ""low profile"" on school desegregation, but the administration enforced court desegregation orders and implemented the first affirmative action plan in the United States. Nixon also presided over the creation of Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of major environmental laws like the Clean Water Act. Economically, the Nixon years saw the start of a period of ""stagflation"" that would continue into the 1970s.
Nixon was far ahead in the polls in the 1972 presidential election, but during the campaign, Nixon operatives conducted several illegal operations designed to undermine the opposition. They were exposed when the break-in of the Democratic National Committee Headquarters, ended in the arrest of five burglars and gave rise to a congressional investigation.

193,1973,March,8,"The Provisional Irish Republican Army undertakes its first operation in Great Britain, planting four car bombs in London; 10 members of PIRA are arrested at Heathrow Airport while trying to leave the country",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army_campaign,"From 1969 until 1997, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) conducted an armed paramilitary campaign primarily in Northern Ireland and England, aimed at ending British rule in Northern Ireland in order to create a united Ireland.The Provisional IRA emerged from a split in the Irish Republican Army in 1969, partly as a result of that organisation's perceived failure to defend Catholic neighbourhoods from attack in the 1969 Northern Ireland riots. The Provisionals gained credibility from their efforts to physically defend such areas in 1970 and 1971. From 1971–72, the IRA took to the offensive and conducted a relatively high intensity campaign against the British and Northern Ireland security forces and the infrastructure of the state. The British Army characterised this period as the 'insurgency phase' of the IRA's campaign.
The IRA declared a brief ceasefire in 1972 and a more protracted one in 1975, when there was an internal debate over the feasibility of future operations. The armed group reorganised itself in the late 1970s into a smaller, cell-based structure, which was designed to be harder to penetrate. The IRA now tried to carry out a smaller scale but more sustained campaign which they characterised as the 'Long War', with the eventual aim of weakening the British government's resolve to remain in Ireland. The British Army called this the 'terrorist phase' of the IRA's campaign.
The IRA made some attempts in the 1980s to escalate the conflict with the aid of weapons imported from Libya. In the 1990s they also began a campaign of bombing economic targets in London and other cities in England.
On 31 August 1994, the IRA called a unilateral ceasefire with the aim of having their associated political party, Sinn Féin, admitted into the Northern Ireland peace process. The organisation ended its ceasefire in February 1996 but declared another in July 1997. The IRA accepted the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 as a negotiated end to the Northern Ireland conflict. In 2005 the organisation declared a formal end to its campaign and had its weaponry decommissioned under international supervision.
Other aspects of the Provisional IRA's campaign are covered in the following articles:

Later destroyed in 9/11 terrorist attacks.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001),"The original World Trade Center was a large complex of seven buildings in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City, United States. It opened on April 4, 1973, and was destroyed in 2001 during the September 11 attacks. At the time of their completion, the Twin Towers—the original 1 World Trade Center, at 1,368 feet (417 m); and 2 World Trade Center, at 1,362 feet (415.1 m)—were the tallest buildings in the world. Other buildings in the complex included the Marriott World Trade Center (3 WTC), 4 WTC, 5 WTC, 6 WTC, and 7 WTC. The complex contained 13,400,000 square feet (1,240,000 m2) of office space.
The core complex was built between 1966 and 1975, at a cost of $400 million (equivalent to $2.27 billion in 2018). During its existence, the World Trade Center experienced several major incidents, including a fire on February 13, 1975, a bombing on February 26, 1993, and a bank robbery on January 14, 1998. In 1998, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey decided to privatize it by leasing the buildings to a private company to manage. It awarded the lease to Silverstein Properties in July 2001.On the morning of September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda-affiliated hijackers flew two Boeing 767 jets into the North and South Towers within minutes of each other; two hours later, both towers collapsed. The attacks killed 2,606 people in and within the vicinity of the towers, as well as all 157 on board the two aircraft. Falling debris from the towers, combined with fires that the debris initiated in several surrounding buildings, led to the partial or complete collapse of all the buildings in the complex, and caused catastrophic damage to ten other large structures in the surrounding area.
The cleanup and recovery process at the World Trade Center site took eight months, during which the remains of the other buildings were demolished. A new World Trade Center complex is being built with six new skyscrapers and several other buildings, many of which are complete. A memorial and museum to those killed in the attacks, a new rapid transit hub, and an elevated park have been opened. One World Trade Center, the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere at 1,776 feet (541 m) and the lead building for the new complex, was completed in November 2014.
During its existence, the World Trade Center was an icon of New York City. It had a major role in popular culture and according to one estimate was depicted in 472 films. Following the World Trade Center's destruction, mentions of the complex were altered or deleted, and several dozen ""memorial films"" were created.",set(),0,"['World Trade Center', 'New York', 'World Trade Center', 'the Financial District', 'Manhattan', 'New York City', 'United States', 'April 4, 1973', '2001', 'September 11', 'Twin', '1 World Trade Center', 'World Trade Center', 'the Marriott World Trade Center', 'between 1966 and 1975', '2018', 'the World Trade Center', 'February 13, 1975', 'February 26, 1993', 'January 14, 1998', '1998', 'the Port Authority of New York', 'New Jersey', 'Silverstein Properties', 'July', 'Al-Qaeda', 'Boeing', '767', 'North', 'the World Trade Center', 'eight months', 'World Trade Center', 'World Trade Center', 'the Western Hemisphere', 'November 2014', 'the World Trade Center', 'New York City', ""the World Trade Center's""]","['ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG']"

The bridge extends between Ortaköy (in Europe) and Beylerbeyi (in Asia).
It is a gravity-anchored suspension bridge with steel towers and inclined hangers. The aerodynamic deck hangs on steel cables. It is 1,560 m (5,118 ft) long with a deck width of 33.40 m (110 ft). The distance between the towers (main span) is 1,074 m (3,524 ft) and the total height of the towers is 165 m (541 ft). The clearance of the bridge from sea level is 64 m (210 ft).Upon its completion in 1973, the Bosphorus Bridge had the fourth-longest suspension bridge span in the world, and the longest outside the United States (only the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, Golden Gate Bridge and Mackinac Bridge had a longer span in 1973). The Bosphorus Bridge remained the longest suspension bridge in Europe until the completion of the Humber Bridge in 1981, and the longest suspension bridge in Asia until the completion of the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge (Second Bosphorus Bridge) in 1988 (which was surpassed by the Minami Bisan-Seto Bridge in 1989). Currently, the Bosphorus Bridge has the 33rd-longest suspension bridge span in the world.
After a group of soldiers took control and partially closed off the bridge during the military coup d'état attempt on 15 July 2016, Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım announced on 25 July 2016 the decision of the Cabinet of Turkey that the bridge will be formally renamed as the 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü (July 15th Martyrs Bridge) in memory of those killed while resisting the attempted coup.",set(),0,"['The Bosphorus Bridge', 'Istanbul', 'Turkey', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'The Bosphorus Bridge', 'Turkish', 'Boğaziçi Köprüsü', 'July Martyrs Bridge', 'Turkish', 'Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü', 'the First Bridge', 'Turkish', 'Bosphorus', 'Turkish', 'Boğaziçi', 'Istanbul', 'Turkey', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'Fatih Sultan', 'Mehmet Bridge', 'Yavuz Sultan', 'Ortaköy', 'Europe', 'Beylerbeyi', 'Asia', '1973', 'the Bosphorus Bridge', 'the United States', 'the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge', 'Golden Gate Bridge', 'Mackinac Bridge', '1973', 'The Bosphorus Bridge', 'Europe', 'the Humber Bridge', '1981', 'Asia', 'Fatih', 'Sultan Mehmet Bridge', '1988', 'the Minami Bisan-Seto Bridge', '1989', 'the Bosphorus Bridge', '15 July 2016', 'Binali Yıldırım', '25 July 2016', 'the Cabinet of Turkey', 'Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü', 'July 15th', 'Martyrs Bridge']","['FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG']"
199,1973,December,15,American Psychiatric Association declares homosexuality is not a mental illness,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy,"Conversion therapy is the pseudoscientific practice of trying to change an individual's sexual orientation from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual using psychological or spiritual interventions. There is no reliable evidence that sexual orientation can be changed and medical institutions warn that conversion therapy practices are ineffective and potentially harmful. Medical, scientific, and government organizations in the United States and United Kingdom have expressed concern over the validity, efficacy and ethics of conversion therapy. Various jurisdictions around the world have passed laws against conversion therapy.
The American Psychiatric Association (APA) opposes psychiatric treatment ""based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation"" and describes attempts to change a person's sexual orientation by practitioners as unethical. It also states that the advancement of conversion therapy may cause social harm by disseminating unscientific views about sexual orientation. In 2001, United States Surgeon General David Satcher issued a report stating that ""there is no valid scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed"".Techniques used in conversion therapy in the United States and Western Europe have included ice-pick lobotomies; chemical castration with hormonal treatment; aversive treatments, such as ""the application of electric shock to the hands and/or genitals""; ""nausea-inducing drugs ... administered simultaneously with the presentation of homoerotic stimuli""; and masturbatory reconditioning. More recent clinical techniques used in the United States have been limited to counseling, visualization, social skills training, psychoanalytic therapy, and spiritual interventions such as ""prayer and group support and pressure"", though there are some reports of aversive treatments through unlicensed practice as late as the early 2000s. The term reparative therapy has been used as a synonym for conversion therapy in general, but it has been argued that strictly speaking it refers to a specific kind of therapy associated with the psychologists Elizabeth Moberly and Joseph Nicolosi.The National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) was the main organization advocating for conversion therapy.

The total number of staff is 35,402 when part-time, flexible, and fixed-contract staff are included.The BBC is established under a Royal Charter and operates under its Agreement with the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Its work is funded principally by an annual television licence fee which is charged to all British households, companies, and organisations using any type of equipment to receive or record live television broadcasts and iPlayer catch-up. The fee is set by the British Government, agreed by Parliament, and used to fund the BBC's radio, TV, and online services covering the nations and regions of the UK. Since 1 April 2014, it has also funded the BBC World Service (launched in 1932 as the BBC Empire Service), which broadcasts in 28 languages and provides comprehensive TV, radio, and online services in Arabic and Persian.
Around a quarter of BBC's revenue comes from its commercial subsidiary BBC Studios (formerly BBC Worldwide), which sells BBC programmes and services internationally and also distributes the BBC's international 24-hour English-language news services BBC World News, and from BBC.com, provided by BBC Global News Ltd. In 2009, the company was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in recognition of its international achievements.From its inception, through the Second World War (where its broadcasts helped to unite the nation), to the 21st century, the BBC has played a prominent role in British life and culture.

201,1973,August,2,"""American Graffiti"", directed by George Lucas and starring Richard Dreyfuss and Ron Howard premieres at the Locarno International Film Festival, Switzerland",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Graffiti,"American Graffiti is a 1973 American coming-of-age comedy film directed and co-written by George Lucas starring Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Paul Le Mat, Harrison Ford, Charles Martin Smith, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark, Mackenzie Phillips, Bo Hopkins, and Wolfman Jack. Suzanne Somers, Kathleen Quinlan, Debralee Scott and Joe Spano also appear in the film.
Set in Modesto, California, in 1962, the film is a study of the cruising and early rock 'n' roll cultures popular among Lucas's age group at the time. Through a series of vignettes, the film tells the story of a group of teenagers and their adventures over the course of a single night.
The genesis of American Graffiti was in Lucas' own teenage years in early 1960s Modesto. He was unsuccessful in pitching the concept to financiers and distributors, but found favor at Universal Pictures after every other major film studio turned him down. Filming was initially set to take place in San Rafael, California, but the production crew was denied permission to shoot beyond a second day. As a result, production was moved to Petaluma.
American Graffiti premiered on August 2, 1973, at the Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland, and was released on August 11, 1973, in the United States. The film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Produced on a $777,000 budget, it has become one of the most profitable films of all time. Since its initial release, American Graffiti has garnered an estimated return of well over $200 million in box office gross and home video sales, not including merchandising. In 1995 the United States Library of Congress deemed the film ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

Starring Martin Sheen, Sissy Spacek, Warren Oates and Ramon Bieri, the story, though fictional, is loosely based on the real-life murder spree of Charles Starkweather and his girlfriend, Caril Ann Fugate, in 1958, though that basis was not acknowledged when the film was released. Like many of Malick's films, Badlands is notable for its lyrical photography, and its music, which includes pieces by Carl Orff.

Badlands is often cited by film critics as one of the greatest and most influential films of all time.

203,1973,March,1,"Pink Floyd release their album ""Dark Side of the Moon"", since sold over 45 million copies",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon,"The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. Primarily developed during live performances, the band premiered an early version of the record several months before recording began. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London.
The record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised their earlier work. A concept album, its themes explore conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by the deteriorating health of founding member Syd Barrett, who departed the group in 1968. The group used recording techniques such as multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers. Snippets from interviews with the band's road crew, as well as philosophical quotations, were also used. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer Clare Torry, who appears on ""The Great Gig in the Sky"". The sleeve, which depicts a prism spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson, following keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a ""simple and bold"" design, representing the band's lighting and the record's themes. The album was promoted with two singles: ""Money"" and ""Us and Them"".
The Dark Side of the Moon received critical acclaim upon release, and has since been hailed by critics as one of the greatest albums of all time. The record reached number one on the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart (now known as the Billboard 200), and has charted for over 900 weeks in total. With estimated sales of over 45 million copies, it is Pink Floyd's best seller, and one of the best-selling albums worldwide. The record helped to propel Pink Floyd to international fame, bringing wealth and recognition to all four of its members. It has been remastered and re-released on several occasions, most recently for digital distribution.","{7, 2568, 521, 3083, 528, 4113, 3090, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1566, 1058, 4642, 4134, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4647, 3630, 1584, 2102, 2104, 1081, 3139, 580, 2628, 4675, 4688, 1622, 2649, 2652, 4192, 609, 2152, 2155, 1137, 1649, 2169, 3195, 640, 2176, 131, 4235, 653, 2703, 144, 3727, 1170, 154, 4768, 3234, 2213, 1703, 1192, 1197, 4785, 3777, 4807, 2764, 717, 3277, 3795, 4307, 3804, 3805, 4829, 3808, 3303, 4330, 2798, 1783, 2296, 2297, 3322, 1275, 3842, 771, 1292, 3869, 4895, 290, 3365, 294, 4905, 3885, 815, 4915, 311, 2875, 4923, 1341, 4413, 3903, 1857, 3908, 839, 2379, 2891, 4941, 4942, 2388, 3927, 4951, 352, 1386, 4971, 4472, 889, 3451, 4990, 4480, 4993, 4994, 387, 900, 2948, 3460, 1929, 3979, 3468, 4492, 401, 1432, 3999, 423, 430, 4014, 1465, 5059, 452, 964, 4549, 2507, 2508, 1997, 5067, 463, 1999, 2004, 5077, 5079, 3544, 3034, 478, 1502, 3040, 492, 494, 5107, 2040, 5115, 511}",153,"['Floyd', 'Moon', 'English', 'Pink Floyd', '1 March 1973', 'Harvest Records', 'several months', '1972', '1973', 'Abbey Road Studios', 'London', 'Floyd', 'Syd Barrett', '1968', 'Alan Parsons', 'Clare Torry', 'The Great Gig', 'Storm Thorgerson', ""Richard Wright's"", 'Moon', 'US', 'Billboard Top LPs & Tape', '900 weeks', ""Pink Floyd's"", 'Pink Floyd']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON']"

It is one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings.Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed up by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.The building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and close by the Sydney Harbour Bridge.The building comprises multiple performance venues, which together host well over 1,500 performances annually, attended by more than 1.2 million people. Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, including three resident companies: Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, the site is visited by more than eight million people annually, and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year. The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust, an agency of the New South Wales State Government.

On 28 June 2007, the Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site, having been listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate since 1980, the National Trust of Australia register since 1983, the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000, the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003, and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005.

206,1973,December,5,"Paul McCartney & Wings release album ""Band on the Run"" in the US",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_on_the_Run,"Band on the Run is the third studio album by the British–American rock band Paul McCartney and Wings, released in December 1973. It was McCartney's fifth album after leaving the Beatles in April 1970. Although sales were modest initially, its commercial performance was aided by two hit singles – ""Jet"" and ""Band on the Run"" – such that it became the top-selling studio album of 1974 in the United Kingdom and Australia, in addition to revitalising McCartney's critical standing. It remains McCartney's most successful album and the most celebrated of his post-Beatles works.
The majority of Band on the Run was recorded at EMI's studio in Lagos, Nigeria, as McCartney wanted to make an album in an exotic locale. Shortly before departing for Lagos, however, drummer Denny Seiwell and guitarist Henry McCullough left the group. With no time to recruit replacements, McCartney went into the studio with just his wife Linda and Denny Laine.  In addition to playing bass, McCartney also played drums, percussion and most of the lead guitar parts himself. On arriving, it was discovered that the studio was below standard, and conditions in Nigeria were tense and difficult; the McCartneys were robbed at knifepoint, during which a bag containing unfinished song lyrics and demo tapes was taken. After the band's return to England, final overdubs and further recording were carried out in London, mostly at AIR Studios.
In 2000, Q magazine placed it at number 75 in its list of the ""100 Greatest British Albums Ever"". In 2012, Band on the Run was voted 418th on Rolling Stone's revised list of ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"". A contemporary review by Jon Landau in Rolling Stone described the album as ""with the possible exception of John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band, the finest record yet released by any of the four musicians who were once called the Beatles"". It was McCartney's last album issued on the Apple record label.","{4611, 4101, 2568, 521, 528, 4113, 3090, 1562, 2589, 2078, 4642, 1573, 4134, 4647, 1576, 4140, 2096, 561, 563, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4688, 2649, 619, 2155, 1136, 625, 1649, 1653, 2169, 2682, 3195, 2171, 640, 2176, 4605, 131, 2703, 3727, 4768, 2210, 1699, 677, 2213, 690, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 4313, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3303, 747, 748, 2798, 1265, 1783, 3834, 1275, 4859, 1795, 1284, 4879, 1808, 3869, 4895, 290, 803, 294, 807, 1319, 4905, 4400, 4915, 4916, 309, 310, 311, 1847, 826, 2875, 2891, 4940, 4941, 4942, 3927, 4474, 3451, 4990, 4993, 386, 3459, 3460, 3970, 4994, 2955, 3979, 3989, 1432, 5019, 4007, 5033, 4014, 2995, 4024, 4536, 4539, 452, 4549, 1990, 967, 5065, 971, 1483, 1997, 2507, 2508, 5077, 3034, 3040, 2018, 4579, 997, 3046, 492, 5106, 5107, 2040, 5117}",134,"['Paul McCartney & Wings', 'Band on the Run', 'US', 'Run', 'British', 'American', 'Paul McCartney', 'Wings', 'December 1973', 'McCartney', 'Beatles', 'April 1970', 'Band on the Run', '1974', 'the United Kingdom', 'Australia', 'McCartney', 'McCartney', 'Band', 'Run', 'EMI', 'Lagos', 'Nigeria', 'McCartney', 'Denny Seiwell', 'Henry McCullough', 'McCartney', 'Linda', 'Denny Laine', 'McCartney', 'Nigeria', 'McCartneys', 'knifepoint', 'England', 'London', 'AIR Studios', '2000', '2012', 'Band', 'Run', ""Rolling Stone's"", 'The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time', 'Jon Landau', 'Rolling Stone', ""John Lennon's"", 'Beatles', 'McCartney', 'Apple']","['ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG']"

He then became one of the most successful sires of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, The Blood-Horse ranked him as one of the top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century. As a sire of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.
At age two, Northern Dancer was named the Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt after winning both the Summer Stakes and Coronation Futurity in Canada, plus the Remsen Stakes in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the Flamingo Stakes, Florida Derby, and Blue Grass Stakes. Northern Dancer followed up a narrow victory in the Kentucky Derby by winning the Preakness Stakes. With a chance at the American Triple Crown, he finished third in the Belmont Stakes. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the Queen's Plate in what proved to be his last race.
Northern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at Windfields Farm in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by English Triple Crown winner Nijinsky, brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.","{2051, 1539, 4611, 7, 2568, 1052, 4642, 36, 4134, 1576, 4688, 595, 2141, 607, 3686, 1640, 3180, 1646, 1136, 2169, 2682, 2171, 3199, 4224, 4736, 1668, 4235, 1678, 2702, 656, 1177, 2721, 2210, 694, 699, 1739, 4815, 4307, 3803, 3812, 748, 1780, 3322, 3842, 1795, 1802, 3862, 290, 4400, 1847, 4920, 826, 4413, 4426, 4430, 1888, 1890, 873, 4971, 1388, 3954, 1395, 889, 3451, 892, 4990, 387, 2955, 1938, 403, 3989, 1432, 418, 4007, 2483, 1985, 3524, 1990, 967, 2507, 5074, 4051, 5088, 2018, 997, 4589}",86,"['Ron Turcotte', 'Secretariat', 'Triple Crown', '25 years', 'Northern Dancer', 'May 27, 1961', 'November 16, 1990', 'Thoroughbred', '1964', 'Canadian', 'Kentucky', 'the 20th century', 'Canadian', 'the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame', '1965', 'the Racing Hall of Fame', 'Canada', 'the United States', '1976', 'U.S. Thoroughbred', 'the 20th century', 'age two', 'Northern Dancer', 'Canadian', 'Two-Year-Old', 'Canada', 'the Remsen Stakes', 'New York', 'Kentucky', 'Flamingo Stakes', 'Florida Derby', 'Blue Grass Stakes', 'Kentucky', 'the Preakness Stakes', 'the American Triple Crown', 'the Belmont Stakes', 'Canada', ""the Queen's Plate"", 'Northern Dancer', '1965', 'Windfields Farm', 'Canada', '1968', 'English', 'Nijinsky', 'Maryland', 'Windfields Farm']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG']"

210,1973,October,20,President Nixon proclaims Jim Thorpe greatest athlete of 1st ½ century,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Thorpe,"James Francis Thorpe (Sac and Fox (Sauk): Wa-Tho-Huk, translated as ""Bright Path""; May 22 or 28, 1887 – March 28, 1953) was an American athlete and Olympic gold medalist. A member of the Sac and Fox Nation, Thorpe became the first Native American to win a gold medal for the United States. Considered one of the most versatile athletes of modern sports, he won Olympic gold medals in the 1912 pentathlon and decathlon, and played American football (collegiate and professional), professional baseball, and basketball. He lost his Olympic titles after it was found he had been paid for playing two seasons of semi-professional baseball before competing in the Olympics, thus violating the amateurism rules that were then in place.  In 1983, 30 years after his death, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) restored his Olympic medals.

Thorpe grew up in the Sac and Fox Nation in Oklahoma, and attended Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where he was a two-time All-American for the school's football team. After his Olympic success in 1912, which included a record score in the decathlon, he added a victory in the All-Around Championship of the Amateur Athletic Union. In 1913, Thorpe signed with the New York Giants, and he played six seasons in Major League Baseball between 1913 and 1919. Thorpe joined the Canton Bulldogs American football team in 1915, helping them win three professional championships; he later played for six teams in the National Football League (NFL). He played as part of several all-American Indian teams throughout his career, and barnstormed as a professional basketball player with a team composed entirely of American Indians.
From 1920 to 1921, Thorpe was nominally the first president of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which became the NFL in 1922. He played professional sports until age 41, the end of his sports career coinciding with the start of the Great Depression.  He struggled to earn a living after that, working several odd jobs. He suffered from alcoholism, and lived his last years in failing health and poverty. He was married three times and had eight children, before suffering from heart failure and dying in 1953.
Thorpe has received various accolades for his athletic accomplishments.

212,1973,January,21,Actress Jane Fonda weds activist Tom Hayden,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda,"Jane Seymour Fonda (born December 21, 1937) is an American actress, political activist, and former fashion model. She is the recipient of various accolades including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, the AFI Life Achievement Award, and the Honorary Golden Lion.Born to actor Henry Fonda and socialite Frances Ford Seymour, Fonda made her acting debut with the 1960 Broadway play There Was a Little Girl, for which she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play, and made her screen debut later the same year with the romantic comedy Tall Story. She rose to prominence in the 1960s with such films as Period of Adjustment (1962), Sunday in New York (1963), Cat Ballou (1965), Barefoot in the Park (1967), and Barbarella (1968). Her first husband was Barbarella director Roger Vadim. A seven-time Academy Award nominee, she received her first nomination for They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969), and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress twice in the 1970s for Klute (1971) and Coming Home (1978). Her other nominations were for Julia (1977), The China Syndrome (1979), On Golden Pond (1981), and The Morning After (1986). Consecutive hits Fun with Dick and Jane (1977), California Suite (1978), The Electric Horseman (1979), and 9 to 5 (1980) sustained Fonda's box-office drawing power, and she won a Primetime Emmy Award for her performance in the TV film The Dollmaker (1984).
In 1982, she released her first exercise video, Jane Fonda's Workout, which became the highest-selling VHS of all time. It would be the first of 22 such videos over the next 13 years, which would collectively sell over 17 million copies. Divorced from her second husband Tom Hayden, she married billionaire media mogul Ted Turner in 1991 and retired from acting, following a row of commercially unsuccessful films concluded by Stanley & Iris (1990). Fonda divorced Turner in 2001 and returned to the screen with the hit Monster-in-Law (2005). Although Georgia Rule (2007) was the star's only other movie during the 2000s, in the early 2010s she fully re-launched her career. Subsequent films have included The Butler (2013), This Is Where I Leave You (2014), Youth (2015), Our Souls at Night (2017), and Book Club (2018). In 2009, she returned to Broadway after a 49-year absence from the stage, in the play 33 Variations which earned her a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play, while her major recurring role in the HBO drama series The Newsroom (2012–14) earned her two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. She also released another five exercise videos between 2009 and 2012. Fonda currently stars as Grace Hanson in the Netflix comedy series Grace and Frankie, which debuted in 2015 and has earned her nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and three Screen Actors Guild Awards.
Fonda was a visible political activist in the counterculture era during the Vietnam War. She was photographed sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun on a 1972 visit to Hanoi, during which she gained the nickname ""Hanoi Jane"". During this time, she was effectively blacklisted in Hollywood. She has also protested the Iraq War and violence against women, and describes herself as a feminist and environmental activist. In 2005, along with Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem, she co-founded the Women's Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices of women in the media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content. Fonda serves on the board of the organization.","{4097, 519, 2568, 3081, 7, 524, 1036, 3601, 2067, 3091, 4115, 28, 34, 3621, 1576, 4649, 4140, 1583, 563, 565, 4661, 1081, 4671, 576, 2112, 3139, 580, 4675, 583, 586, 75, 1616, 2647, 3676, 612, 3686, 2152, 3692, 1646, 632, 2169, 127, 130, 1162, 4235, 1678, 1177, 154, 666, 4763, 4774, 1703, 1192, 3243, 4268, 1197, 174, 1709, 4785, 694, 703, 4287, 2241, 1222, 1742, 208, 1233, 3803, 4829, 1251, 3813, 3814, 2793, 748, 1272, 3322, 1795, 1288, 1292, 271, 272, 1307, 3874, 1319, 3371, 303, 4400, 4923, 4413, 3903, 1857, 2375, 843, 2379, 2901, 3413, 3927, 4437, 1370, 3934, 352, 1890, 355, 3427, 1898, 1905, 882, 889, 3451, 892, 4990, 4992, 4993, 3459, 900, 3463, 3978, 2955, 3979, 5010, 2964, 2982, 424, 2475, 4526, 1455, 4017, 2483, 948, 4020, 2487, 1464, 2489, 4024, 1979, 4536, 5052, 3524, 460, 1997, 4558, 463, 2000, 4561, 2004, 4056, 3046, 2026, 4074, 494, 2039, 1017, 3578, 4605}",154,"['Actress Jane Fonda', 'Tom Hayden', 'Jane Seymour Fonda', 'December 21, 1937', 'American', 'Academy Awards', 'BAFTA Awards', 'Primetime Emmy Award', 'the AFI Life Achievement Award', 'the Honorary Golden Lion', 'Henry Fonda', 'Frances Ford Seymour', 'Fonda', '1960', 'Broadway', 'There Was a Little Girl', 'the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress', 'later the same year', 'Tall Story', 'the 1960s', '1962', 'Sunday', 'New York', '1963', 'Cat Ballou', '1965', 'Barefoot', '1967', 'Barbarella', '1968', 'Barbarella', 'Roger Vadim', 'Academy Award', '1969', 'the Academy Award for Best Actress', 'the 1970s', 'Klute', '1971', 'Coming Home', '1978', 'Julia', '1977', 'The China Syndrome', '1979', 'Golden Pond', '1981', 'The Morning After', '1986', 'Dick', 'Jane', '1977', 'California Suite (', '1978', 'The Electric Horseman', '1979', '1980', 'Fonda', 'Primetime Emmy', 'Dollmaker', '1984', '1982', ""Jane Fonda's"", 'the next 13 years', 'Tom Hayden', 'Ted Turner', '1991', 'Stanley & Iris', '1990', 'Fonda', 'Turner', '2001', '2005', 'Georgia Rule', '2007', 'the 2000s', 'the early 2010s', '2014', '2015', '2017', 'Book Club', '2018', '2009', 'Broadway', 'the Tony Award for Best Actress', 'HBO', 'The Newsroom', 'Primetime Emmy', 'between 2009 and 2012', 'Fonda', 'Grace Hanson', 'Netflix', 'Grace', 'Frankie', '2015', 'Primetime Emmy Award', 'Fonda', 'the Vietnam War', 'North Vietnamese', '1972', 'Hanoi', 'Hanoi Jane', 'Hollywood', 'the Iraq War', '2005', 'Robin Morgan', 'Gloria Steinem', ""the Women's Media Center"", 'Fonda']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'LAW', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON']"

He was born Ying Zheng (嬴政) or Zhao Zheng (趙政), a prince of the state of Qin. He became Zheng, the King of Qin (秦王政) when he was thirteen, then China's first emperor when he was 38 after the Qin had conquered all of the other Warring States and unified all of China in 221 BC. Rather than maintain the title of ""king"" (王 wáng) borne by the previous Shang and Zhou rulers, he ruled as the First Emperor (始皇帝) of the Qin dynasty from 221 BC to 210 BC. His self-invented title ""emperor"" (皇帝 huángdì), as indicated by his use of the word ""First"", would continue to be borne by Chinese rulers for the next two millennia.
During his reign, his generals greatly expanded the size of the Chinese state: campaigns south of Chu permanently added the Yue lands of Hunan and Guangdong to the Chinese cultural orbit; campaigns in Central Asia conquered the Ordos Loop from the nomad Xiongnu, although eventually it would also lead to their confederation under Modu Chanyu.
Qin Shi Huang also worked with his minister Li Si to enact major economic and political reforms aimed at the standardization of the diverse practices of the earlier Chinese states. He is traditionally said to have banned and burned many books and executed scholars, though a closer examination renders the account doubtful. His public works projects included the unification of diverse state walls into a single Great Wall of China and a massive new national road system, as well as the city-sized mausoleum guarded by the life-sized Terracotta Army. He ruled until his death in 210 BC during his fourth tour of Eastern China.","{128, 903, 523, 4235, 3998, 2210, 4642, 3508, 1467, 1979, 4413, 3520, 1985, 967, 2507, 4307, 1370, 4445, 2529, 4971, 4589, 3702, 2170}",23,"['Chinese', 'the Terracotta Army', ""Xi'an"", 'China', 'Qin Shi Huang', 'Qin Shi Huang', 'Chinese', '18 February 259', '10 September 210', 'Qin', 'China', 'Ying Zheng', 'Zhao Zheng', 'Qin', 'Zheng', 'the King of Qin', 'China', '38', 'Qin', 'Warring States', 'China', 'BC', 'Shang', 'Zhou', 'Qin', 'BC', 'Chinese', 'the next two millennia', 'Chinese', 'Chu', 'Yue', 'Hunan', 'Guangdong', 'Chinese', 'Central Asia', 'the Ordos Loop', 'Modu Chanyu', 'Qin Shi Huang', 'Li Si', 'Chinese', 'Terracotta Army', 'Eastern China']","['NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'LOC']"

218,1974,April,20,"'The Troubles', the Northern Ireland conflict between republican and loyalist paramilitaries, British security forces, and civil rights groups, claims its 1000th victim",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles,"The Troubles (Irish: Na Trioblóidí) were an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict  it is sometimes described as an ""irregular war"" or ""low-level war"". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles primarily took place in Northern Ireland, at times the violence spilled over into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England, and mainland Europe.
The conflict was primarily political and nationalistic, fuelled by historical events. It also had an ethnic or sectarian dimension, although it was not a religious conflict. A key issue was the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Unionists/loyalists, who were mostly Protestants, wanted Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom. Irish nationalists/republicans, who were mostly Catholics, wanted Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and join a united Ireland.
The conflict began during a campaign by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to end discrimination against the Catholic/nationalist minority by the Protestant/unionist government and police force. The authorities attempted to suppress this protest campaign and were accused of police brutality; it was also met with violence from loyalists, who alleged it was a republican front. Increasing tensions led to severe violence in August 1969 and the deployment of British troops, in what became the British Army's longest ever operation. They built 'peace walls' to keep the two communities apart. Some Catholics initially welcomed the army as a more neutral force, but it soon came to be seen as hostile and biased, particularly after Bloody Sunday in 1972. The emergence of armed paramilitary organisations led to subsequent warfare over the next three decades.
The main participants in the Troubles were republican paramilitaries such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA); loyalist paramilitaries such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA); British state security forces—the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC); and political activists and politicians. The security forces of the Republic of Ireland played a smaller role. Republican paramilitaries carried out a guerrilla campaign against British security forces as well as a bombing campaign against infrastructure, commercial and political targets. Loyalists targeted republicans/nationalists and attacked the wider Catholic community in what they described as retaliation. At times, there were bouts of sectarian tit-for-tat violence. The British security forces undertook both a policing and counter-insurgency role, primarily against republicans. There were some incidents of collusion between British security forces and loyalists. The Troubles also involved numerous riots, mass protests and acts of civil disobedience and led to segregation and the creation of no-go areas.
More than 3,500 people were killed in the conflict, of whom 52% were civilians, 32% were members of the British security forces and 16% were members of paramilitary groups. There has been sporadic violence since the Good Friday Agreement was signed, including ongoing punishment attacks and a campaign by dissident republicans.",set(),0,"[""The Troubles'"", 'Northern Ireland', 'republican', 'British', 'Irish', 'Na Trioblóidí', 'Northern Ireland', 'the late 20th century', 'Northern Ireland', 'the late 1960s', '1998', 'Troubles', 'Northern Ireland', 'the Republic of Ireland', 'England', 'Europe', 'Northern Ireland', 'Protestants', 'Northern Ireland', 'the United Kingdom', 'Irish', 'republicans', 'Catholics', 'Northern Ireland', 'the United Kingdom', 'united Ireland', 'the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association', 'Catholic', 'Protestant', 'republican', 'August 1969', 'British', ""the British Army's"", 'Catholics', 'Sunday', '1972', 'the next three decades', 'republican', 'the Provisional Irish Republican Army', 'the Irish National Liberation Army', 'INLA', 'the Ulster Volunteer Force', 'UVF', 'Ulster Defence Association', 'UDA', 'British', 'the British Army', 'Royal Ulster Constabulary', 'the Republic of Ireland', 'Republican', 'British', 'republicans', 'Catholic', 'British', 'republicans', 'British', '52%', '32%', 'British', '16%', 'republicans']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERCENT', 'PERCENT', 'NORP', 'PERCENT', 'NORP']"
219,1974,May,18,India becomes the sixth nation to explode an atomic bomb,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki,"The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom, as required by the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the first and only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.
In the final year of World War II, the Allies prepared for a very costly invasion of the Japanese mainland. This undertaking was preceded by a conventional and firebombing campaign which devastated 67 Japanese cities. The war in Europe had concluded when Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8, 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific theater. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945, the alternative being ""prompt and utter destruction"". Japan ignored the ultimatum and the war continued.
By August 1945, the Allies' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bombs, and the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) was equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands. The Allies issued orders for atomic bombs to be used on four Japanese cities on July 25. On August 6, one of the modified B-29s dropped a uranium gun-type bomb (""Little Boy"") on Hiroshima. Another B-29 dropped a plutonium implosion bomb (""Fat Man"") on Nagasaki three days later. The bombs immediately devastated their targets. Over the next two to four months, the acute effects of the atomic bombings killed between 90,000 and 146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000 and 80,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. Large numbers of people continued to die for months afterward from the effects of burns, radiation sickness, and other injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.
Japan surrendered to the Allies on August 15, six days after the Soviet Union's declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September 2 in Tokyo Bay, which effectively ended World War II. Scholars have extensively studied the effects of the bombings on the social and political character of subsequent world history and popular culture, and there is still much debate concerning the ethical and legal justification for the bombings.","{2051, 7, 528, 1555, 3091, 3093, 2076, 1566, 1058, 3110, 4138, 4140, 1583, 1584, 3123, 565, 4661, 1591, 2104, 4675, 4682, 595, 1109, 1622, 2647, 3676, 2141, 606, 608, 1121, 1633, 3686, 1640, 2152, 3693, 1649, 3190, 3702, 3705, 2171, 640, 1153, 1162, 3722, 4235, 2702, 2703, 144, 3727, 663, 1177, 4768, 2210, 4770, 4775, 680, 1192, 3243, 1709, 3252, 2743, 4287, 3777, 1730, 1732, 3272, 2767, 1746, 3795, 4307, 730, 1757, 734, 1251, 2278, 3814, 2793, 234, 4853, 3322, 3326, 1280, 3842, 3332, 1288, 1294, 4879, 283, 4895, 3877, 2342, 1832, 4905, 3882, 302, 3886, 311, 4407, 2875, 3901, 4413, 3908, 4426, 843, 4940, 4944, 2388, 2901, 3413, 2391, 4445, 4971, 2415, 370, 3954, 889, 890, 3451, 4986, 4993, 3970, 4994, 903, 2955, 3979, 5003, 1424, 2964, 3989, 3483, 3490, 4516, 2982, 3501, 4526, 2483, 2487, 1979, 4539, 3520, 452, 453, 964, 3524, 4549, 971, 468, 2004, 5077, 990, 2529, 1508, 5097, 2026, 4074, 3564, 4589, 1526, 2040, 3578, 2555, 4605}",162,"['India', 'The United States', 'Japanese', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'August 6 and 9, 1945', 'the United Kingdom', 'the Quebec Agreement', 'the final year', 'World War II', 'Japanese', 'Japanese', 'Europe', 'Germany', 'May 8, 1945', 'Pacific', 'Allies', 'Imperial', 'Japanese', 'July 26, 1945', 'Japan', 'August 1945', 'Manhattan Project', 'the 509th Composite Group', 'the United States Army Air Forces', 'USAAF', 'Silverplate', 'the Boeing B-29 Superfortress', 'Tinian', 'the Mariana Islands', 'Japanese', 'July 25', 'August 6', 'B-29s', 'Little Boy', 'Hiroshima', 'Fat Man', 'Nagasaki', 'three days later', 'the next two to four months', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'the first day', 'months', 'Hiroshima', 'Japan', 'Allies', 'August 15, six days', ""the Soviet Union's"", 'Nagasaki', 'Japanese', 'September 2', 'Tokyo Bay', 'World War II']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'EVENT']"

221,1974,August,8,US President Richard Nixon announces he will resign at 12pm the next day,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford,"Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King Jr.; July 14, 1913 – December 26, 2006) was an American politician who served as the 38th president of the United States from August 1974 to January 1977. Before his accession to the presidency, Ford served as the 40th vice president of the United States from December 1973 to August 1974. Ford is the only person to have served as both vice president and president without being elected to either office by the Electoral College.
Born in Omaha, Nebraska, and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Ford attended the University of Michigan and Yale Law School. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve, serving from 1942 to 1946; he left as a lieutenant commander. Ford began his political career in 1949 as the U.S. representative from Michigan's 5th congressional district. He served in this capacity for 25 years, the final nine of them as the House Minority Leader. In December 1973, two months after the resignation of Spiro Agnew, Ford became the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment by President Richard Nixon. After the subsequent resignation of President Nixon in August 1974, Ford immediately assumed the presidency. His 895 day-long presidency is the shortest in U.S. history for any president who did not die in office.
As president, Ford signed the Helsinki Accords, which marked a move toward détente in the Cold War. With the collapse of South Vietnam nine months into his presidency, U.S. involvement in Vietnam essentially ended. Domestically, Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the Great Depression, with growing inflation and a recession during his tenure. In one of his most controversial acts, he granted a presidential pardon to President Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal. During Ford's presidency, foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President. In the Republican presidential primary campaign of 1976, Ford defeated former California Governor Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination. He narrowly lost the presidential election to the Democratic challenger, former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter.
Following his years as president, Ford remained active in the Republican Party. His moderate views on various social issues increasingly put him at odds with conservative members of the party in the 1990s and early 2000s. In retirement, Ford set aside the enmity he had felt towards Carter following the 1976 election, and the two former presidents developed a close friendship. After experiencing a series of health problems, he died at home on December 26, 2006.","{4611, 2051, 2568, 521, 3083, 524, 528, 4113, 3090, 1555, 4115, 1562, 2076, 2589, 2078, 1566, 1058, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4647, 2092, 4140, 3630, 1583, 1584, 4649, 565, 4661, 2104, 1081, 4671, 2112, 3139, 580, 2628, 1622, 2647, 2649, 2652, 2141, 3676, 4192, 1633, 612, 2152, 2155, 1133, 1646, 1136, 1649, 1653, 2169, 3195, 2171, 127, 640, 1153, 2176, 131, 4736, 4235, 1678, 2703, 144, 3727, 663, 1177, 154, 4768, 2210, 2213, 4775, 1192, 3243, 173, 174, 1711, 4785, 4287, 3777, 1222, 4807, 1739, 2764, 717, 1742, 3277, 3795, 4307, 4313, 3803, 3804, 3805, 4829, 1251, 3812, 3813, 3303, 2793, 748, 2798, 1783, 1272, 2297, 3322, 1275, 3842, 771, 1795, 4871, 1288, 1292, 1294, 1808, 3862, 3869, 4895, 290, 3874, 2342, 1319, 2856, 4905, 3882, 303, 4400, 4913, 4916, 309, 311, 1847, 826, 2875, 1341, 830, 3903, 4413, 1857, 843, 4941, 4430, 2901, 3413, 4437, 1888, 1890, 1386, 4971, 2415, 889, 4986, 1403, 892, 3451, 4990, 4991, 3970, 3459, 3460, 4994, 2955, 3979, 401, 4498, 5010, 1432, 5022, 418, 4516, 4007, 5033, 4014, 1455, 4526, 2483, 2487, 4536, 1979, 5052, 5059, 452, 964, 3524, 4549, 968, 5065, 971, 1483, 1997, 2507, 2508, 4558, 4561, 5067, 5077, 5079, 3544, 4056, 3034, 2525, 1502, 3040, 1508, 3046, 2026, 492, 1526, 2039, 2040, 3578, 4605}",213,"['US', 'Richard Nixon', 'Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr.', 'Leslie Lynch King Jr.', 'July 14, 1913', 'December 26, 2006', 'American', 'the United States', 'August 1974 to January 1977', 'Ford', 'the United States', 'December 1973 to August 1974', 'Ford', 'the Electoral College', 'Omaha', 'Nebraska', 'Grand Rapids', 'Michigan', 'Ford', 'the University of Michigan', 'Yale Law School', 'Pearl Harbor', 'the U.S. Naval Reserve', '1942 to 1946', 'Ford', '1949', 'U.S.', 'Michigan', '25 years', 'House', 'December 1973', 'two months', 'Spiro Agnew', 'Ford', 'the 25th Amendment', 'Richard Nixon', 'Nixon', 'August 1974', 'Ford', '895 day-long', 'U.S.', 'Ford', 'the Helsinki Accords', 'the Cold War', 'South Vietnam', 'nine months', 'U.S.', 'Vietnam', 'Ford', 'the four decades', 'the Great Depression', 'Richard Nixon', 'Watergate', 'Ford', 'Congress', 'Republican', '1976', 'Ford', 'California', 'Ronald Reagan', 'Republican', 'Democratic', 'Georgia', 'Jimmy Carter', 'his years', 'Ford', 'the Republican Party', 'the 1990s', 'early 2000s', 'Ford', 'Carter', '1976', 'December 26, 2006']","['GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE']"

She has achieved five No. 1 singles in the US, the most for a female singer in the 1970s, other than Diana Ross who had 4 #1 pop singles where Barbra had four #1 pop singles in the 1970s 2 duets and 1 #1 pop in 1980, and sang lead on a No. 1 hit single at least once every year from 1977 to 1980 in the US, a period of 4 consecutive years and the first female performer to achieve it. Streisand also was one of the elite acts with top 10s in four different decades. In 1974, ""The Way We Were"" became the first original single by a female artist to achieve the No. 1 song of the year in US. ""Woman in Love"" from Guilty is one of the best-selling singles of all time in France.In 1964, Streisand became the first and only female artist to place three albums in the top 10 on Billboard's annual albums chart. Five Streisand albums appeared on the Billboard 200 album chart on October 31, 1964, Streisand held the record for the female with the most albums in the Top 200 simultaneously for nearly half a century, until Whitney Houston had ten albums place in the Billboard 200 chart at the same time after fans learned of her death. In 1982, ""Memories"" became the UK's best-selling album of the year, the first album by a female performer to achieve it. During March 5–19, 1977, Streisand became the first female singer to have a No. 1 album (A Star Is Born) and single (Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)) in the same week in the US. Streisand's biggest-selling album, Guilty (1980), was a collaboration with Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees and sold around 15 million copies worldwide as well as spawning several hit singles. In the UK, she became the first female singer to have a No. 1 album (Guilty) and single (""Woman in Love"") in the same week. 25 years later, Streisand and Gibb teamed up again to create Guilty Pleasures, known as Guilty Too in some countries.","{1378, 4741}",2,"[""Barbra Streisand's"", '1st #', 'The Way We Were', 'Barbra Streisand', 'American', 'the United States', 'the United States', 'the Recording Industry Association of America', 'the United States', 'the Recording Industry Association of America', 'Streisand', 'Elvis Presley', 'A Star Is Born', 'Billboard', 'Billboard', 'Streisand', 'Billboard 200', 'Billboard Hot 100', 'each of the last six decades', 'Columbia Records', '1963', 'Streisand', '52 years', 'Higher Ground', '1997', 'Broadway', '1993', 'Love Is the Answer', '2009', '2014', 'Encore:', '2016', 'Billboard 200', 'US', 'the 1970s', 'Diana Ross', 'Barbra', 'the 1970s 2', '1980', 'every year', '1977 to 1980', 'US', '4 consecutive years', 'Streisand', '10s', 'four different decades', '1974', '""The Way We Were"" became the first original single by a female artist to achieve the No. 1 song of the year in US', 'Woman in Love', 'Guilty', 'France', '1964', 'Streisand', 'Billboard', 'annual', 'Streisand', 'October 31, 1964', 'Streisand', 'Whitney Houston', '1982', 'UK', 'the year', 'March 5–19, 1977', 'Streisand', '(A Star Is Born', 'Evergreen', 'the same week', 'US', 'Streisand', 'Guilty', '1980', 'Barry Gibb', 'UK', 'Guilty', 'Woman in Love', 'the same week', '25 years later', 'Streisand', 'Gibb', 'Guilty Pleasures']","['ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG']"
226,1974,February,7,"Mel Brooks' film ""Blazing Saddles"" opens in movie theaters starring Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazing_Saddles,"Blazing Saddles is a 1974 American satirical black comedy-western film directed by Mel Brooks. Starring Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder, the film was written by Brooks, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, Norman Steinberg and Alan Uger, and was based on Bergman's story and draft. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, was nominated for three Academy Awards and is ranked No. 6 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Laughs list.
Brooks appears in three supporting roles, Governor William J. Le Petomane, a Yiddish-speaking Native American chief and ""a director"" in line to help invade Rock Ridge (a nod to Hitchcock); he also dubs lines for one of Lili von Shtupp's backing troupe. The supporting cast includes Slim Pickens, Alex Karras and David Huddleston, as well as Brooks regulars Dom DeLuise, Madeline Kahn and Harvey Korman. Bandleader Count Basie has a cameo as himself, appearing with his orchestra.
The film satirizes the racism obscured by myth-making Hollywood accounts of the American West, with the hero being a black sheriff in an all-white town. The film is full of deliberate anachronisms, from the Count Basie Orchestra playing ""April in Paris"" in the Wild West, to Slim Pickens referring to the Wide World of Sports, to the German army of World War II.
In 2006, Blazing Saddles was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.","{2051, 1539, 4611, 519, 7, 2568, 3091, 2590, 4642, 1576, 4649, 4661, 1081, 1084, 4671, 2112, 4675, 580, 2119, 584, 4174, 595, 2141, 3686, 1133, 1646, 1136, 3186, 2169, 2682, 3195, 127, 4235, 1678, 2191, 2702, 1177, 154, 4763, 2210, 3243, 1709, 1711, 4785, 703, 3268, 1739, 4307, 3803, 4829, 3812, 3813, 748, 3308, 1272, 3322, 3842, 1795, 3332, 4871, 2322, 3862, 283, 3365, 1319, 4400, 1847, 4407, 826, 4413, 830, 2375, 4426, 4430, 4944, 2388, 3413, 4437, 3934, 1888, 1890, 1898, 4971, 889, 3451, 1403, 892, 4990, 387, 900, 3459, 3463, 3978, 2955, 3979, 1938, 2964, 3989, 3490, 5033, 4526, 2483, 3508, 1979, 3524, 1990, 2507, 4558, 2000, 4051, 2004, 3034, 1502, 2018, 5097, 3564, 2039, 3578, 4605}",119,"[""Mel Brooks'"", '""Blazing Saddles"" opens in movie theaters starring', 'Cleavon Little', 'Gene Wilder', '1974', 'American', 'Mel Brooks', 'Starring Cleavon Little', 'Gene Wilder', 'Brooks', 'Andrew Bergman', 'Richard Pryor', 'Norman Steinberg', 'Alan Uger', 'Bergman', 'Academy Awards', ""the American Film Institute's"", '100 Years', 'William J.

The club was previously a biker bar and before that was a dive bar. The letters CBGB were for Country, BlueGrass, and Blues, Kristal's original vision, yet CBGB soon became a famed venue of punk rock and new wave bands like the Ramones, Television, Patti Smith Group, Blondie, and Talking Heads.  From the early 1980s onward, CBGB was known for hardcore punk.One storefront beside CBGB became the ""CBGB Record Canteen"", a record shop and café. In the late 1980s, ""CBGB Record Canteen"" was converted into an art gallery and second performance space, ""CB's 313 Gallery"". CB's Gallery was played by music artists of milder sounds, such as acoustic rock, folk, jazz, or experimental music, such as Dadadah, Kristeen Young and Toshi Reagon, while CBGB continued to showcase mainly hardcore punk, post punk, metal, and alternative rock. 313 Gallery was also the host location for Alchemy, a weekly Goth night showcasing goth, industrial, dark rock, and darkwave bands. On the other side, CBGB was operating a small cafe and bar in the mid-1990s, which served classic New York pizza, among other items.Around 2000, CBGB entered a protracted dispute over allegedly unpaid rent amounts until the landlord, Bowery Residents' Committee, sued in 2005 and lost the case, but a deal to renew CBGB's lease, expiring in 2006, failed.  The club closed upon its final concert, played by Patti Smith, on October 15, 2006.  CBGB Radio launched on the iHeartRadio platform in 2010, and CBGB music festivals began in 2012.  In 2013, CBGB's onetime building, 315 Bowery, was added to the National Register of Historic Places as part of The Bowery Historic District (not a New York City Historic District).","{1539, 7, 524, 1041, 3091, 4642, 4131, 4134, 1576, 3632, 1077, 3648, 4682, 4688, 595, 4704, 97, 2149, 3686, 1640, 2665, 3180, 2169, 3199, 4736, 1668, 4235, 2702, 3734, 157, 2210, 4268, 174, 694, 3783, 4815, 1235, 4307, 4825, 1260, 1780, 3322, 3842, 1795, 3332, 1802, 3348, 1307, 290, 3874, 3371, 815, 4400, 4407, 4413, 3908, 4426, 2388, 3927, 4445, 3427, 4971, 3951, 1395, 889, 3451, 4990, 2955, 3979, 1938, 403, 2964, 2453, 3989, 3999, 3497, 948, 4020, 1979, 4539, 3520, 1985, 967, 2507, 5067, 1997, 4561, 467, 2004, 2525, 1502, 4589}",92,"['NYC', 'New York City', '1973', 'Hilly Kristal', 'Manhattan', 'East Village', 'BlueGrass', 'Blues', 'Kristal', 'Ramones', 'Television', 'Patti Smith Group', 'Blondie', 'Talking Heads', 'the early 1980s', 'the late 1980s', 'Gallery', 'Dadadah', 'Kristeen Young', 'Toshi Reagon', 'Gallery', 'Alchemy', 'weekly', 'the mid-1990s', 'New York', 'Around 2000', 'CBGB', ""Bowery Residents' Committee"", '2005', '2006', 'Patti Smith', 'October 15, 2006', 'CBGB Radio', 'iHeartRadio', '2010', '2012', '2013', 'CBGB', 'the National Register of Historic Places', 'The Bowery Historic District', 'New York City Historic District']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE']"

230,1974,April,4,Hank Aaron ties Babe Ruth's home-run record by hitting his 714th,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth,"George Herman ""Babe"" Ruth Jr. (February 6, 1895 – August 16, 1948) was an American professional baseball player whose career in Major League Baseball (MLB) spanned 22 seasons, from 1914 through 1935. Nicknamed ""The Bambino"" and ""The Sultan of Swat"", he began his MLB career as a star left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees. Ruth established many MLB batting (and some pitching) records, including career home runs (714), runs batted in (RBIs) (2,213), bases on balls (2,062), slugging percentage (.690), and on-base plus slugging (OPS) (1.164); the last two still stand as of 2019. Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time. In 1936, Ruth was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its ""first five"" inaugural members.
At age seven, Ruth was sent to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory where he was mentored by Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Xaverian Brothers, the school's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player. In 1914, Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox. By 1916, he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs, a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 dead-ball era. Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three World Series championship teams with the Red Sox, he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder. With regular playing time, he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919.
After that season, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy. The trade fueled Boston's subsequent 86-year championship drought and popularized the ""Curse of the Bambino"" superstition. In his 15 years with the Yankees, Ruth helped the team win seven American League (AL) pennants and four World Series championships. His big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only drew fans to the ballpark and boosted the sport's popularity but also helped usher in baseball's live-ball era, which evolved from a low-scoring game of strategy to a sport where the home run was a major factor. As part of the Yankees' vaunted ""Murderers' Row"" lineup of 1927, Ruth hit 60 home runs, which extended his MLB single-season record by a single home run. Ruth's last season with the Yankees was 1934; he retired from the game the following year, after a short stint with the Boston Braves. During his career, Ruth led the AL in home runs during a season 12 times.
During Ruth's career, he was the target of intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing. After his retirement as a player, he was denied the opportunity to manage a major league club, most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career. In his final years, Ruth made many public appearances, especially in support of American efforts in World War II. In 1946, he became ill with nasopharyngeal cancer and died from the disease two years later. Ruth remains a part of American culture, and in 2018 President Donald Trump posthumously awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.",set(),0,"['Hank Aaron', ""Babe Ruth's"", 'George Herman', 'Babe"" Ruth Jr.', 'February 6, 1895', 'August 16, 1948', 'American', 'Major League Baseball', '22 seasons', '1914', '1935', 'The Sultan of Swat', 'the Boston Red Sox', 'the New York Yankees', 'Ruth', '2019', 'Ruth', 'American', '1936', 'Ruth', 'the Baseball Hall of Fame', 'age seven', 'Ruth', ""St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys"", 'Matthias Boutlier', 'the Xaverian Brothers', '1914', 'Ruth', 'the Baltimore Orioles', 'the Red Sox', '1916', 'pre-1920', 'Ruth', 'World Series', 'the Red Sox', 'every day', 'MLB', '1919', 'that season', 'Red Sox', 'Harry Frazee', 'Ruth', 'Yankees', 'Boston', 'Curse of the Bambino', 'his 15 years', 'Yankees', 'Ruth', 'American League (AL', 'World Series', 'Yankees', ""Murderers' Row"", '1927', 'Ruth', 'Ruth', 'Yankees', '1934', 'the following year', 'the Boston Braves', 'Ruth', 'season 12', 'Ruth', 'Ruth', 'American', 'World War II', '1946', 'two years later', 'Ruth', 'American', '2018', 'Donald Trump']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON']"
231,1974,April,8,"Hammerin' Hank Aaron hits 715th HR, breaking Babe Ruth's record in Atlanta",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Aaron,"Henry Louis Aaron (born February 5, 1934), nicknamed ""Hammer"" or ""Hammerin' Hank,"" is a retired American Major League Baseball (MLB) right fielder who serves as the senior vice president of the Atlanta Braves. He played 21 seasons for the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves in the National League (NL) and two seasons for the Milwaukee Brewers in the American League (AL), from 1954 through 1976. Aaron held the MLB record for career home runs for 33 years, and he still holds several MLB offensive records. He hit 24 or more home runs every year from 1955 through 1973, and is one of only two players to hit 30 or more home runs in a season at least fifteen times. In 1999, The Sporting News ranked Aaron fifth on its ""100 Greatest Baseball Players"" list.
Aaron was born and raised in and around Mobile, Alabama. Aaron had seven siblings, including Tommie Aaron, who later played in MLB with him. He appeared briefly in the Negro American League and in minor league baseball before starting his major league career. By his final MLB season, Aaron was the last Negro league baseball player on a major league roster.
Aaron played the vast majority of his MLB games in right field, though he appeared at several other infield and outfield positions. In his last two seasons, he was primarily a designated hitter. Aaron was an NL All-Star for 20 seasons and an AL All-Star for 1 season, from 1955 through 1975. Aaron holds the record for the most All-Star Game selections (25), and is tied with Willie Mays and Stan Musial for the most All-Star Games played (24). He was a Gold Glove winner for three seasons. In 1957, he was the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) when the Milwaukee Braves won the World Series. He won the NL Player of the Month award in May 1958 and June 1967. Aaron holds the MLB records for the most career runs batted in (RBI) (2,297), extra base hits (1,477), and total bases (6,856). Aaron is also in the top five for career hits (3,771) and runs (2,174). He is one of only four players to have at least seventeen seasons with 150 or more hits. Aaron is in second place in home runs (755) and at-bats (12,364), and in third place in games played (3,298). At the time of his retirement, Aaron held most of the game's key career power hitting records.
In 1982, he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Since his retirement, Aaron has held front office roles with the Atlanta Braves.

The event had an attendance of 60,000 people. Ali won by knockout, putting Foreman down just before the end of the eighth round.
It has been called ""arguably the greatest sporting event of the 20th century"". It was a major upset victory, with Ali coming in as a 4–1 underdog against the unbeaten, heavy-hitting Foreman. The fight is famous for Ali's introduction of the rope-a-dope tactic.The fight was watched by a record estimated television audience of 1 billion viewers worldwide, becoming the world's most-watched live television broadcast at the time.

240,1975,March,21,"Ethiopia abolishes its monarchy after 3,000 years",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia,"Ethiopia (; Amharic: ኢትዮጵያ, ʾĪtyōṗṗyā, listen , Afar: Itiyoophiyaa, Ge'ez: ኢትዮጵያ. Oromo: Itoophiyaa, Somali: Itoobiya, Tigrinya: ኢትዮጵያ), officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, is a landlocked country in the Horn of Africa. It shares borders with Eritrea to the north, Djibouti to the northeast, Somalia to the east, Kenya to the south, South Sudan to the west and Sudan to the northwest. With over 109 million inhabitants as of 2019, Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world and the second-most populous nation on the African continent. The country has a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres (420,000 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa, which lies a few miles west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the Nubian and Somali tectonic plates.Some of the oldest skeletal evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia. It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond. According to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era. Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BCE, Ethiopia's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history. Oral literature tells that the monarchy was founded by the Solomonic dynasty of the Queen of Sheba, under its first king, Menelik I. In the first centuries, the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region, followed by the Ethiopian Empire c. 1137.
During the late–19th-century Scramble for Africa, Ethiopia and Liberia were the only two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonisation by a European colonial power, and many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours. However, the country was later occupied by Italy in 1936 and became Italian Ethiopia (part of Italian East Africa), until it was liberated during World War II. During the Italian rule, the government abolished slavery, a practice that existed in the country for centuries, and urbanization steadily increased. Ethiopia was also the first independent African member of the 20th-century League of Nations and the United Nations. In 1974, the Ethiopian monarchy under Haile Selassie was overthrown by the Derg, a communist military government backed by the Soviet Union. In 1987, the Derg established the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, but it was overthrown in 1991 by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, which has been the ruling political coalition since.
Ethiopia and Eritrea use the ancient Ge'ez script, which is one of the oldest alphabets still in use in the world. They follow the Ethiopian calendar, which is approximately seven years and three months behind the Gregorian calendar. A majority of the population adheres to Christianity (mainly the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and P'ent'ay), and the historical Kingdom of Aksum was one of the first states to officially adopt the religion, whereas around a third follows Islam (primarily Sunni). The country is the site of the Islamic Migration to Abyssinia and the oldest Muslim settlement in Africa, at Negash. A substantial population of Ethiopian Jews, known as Bete Israel, also resided in Ethiopia until the 1980s. Ethiopia is a multilingual nation, with around 80 ethnolinguistic groups, the four largest of which are the Oromo, Amhara, Somali and Tigrayans. Most people in the country speak Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic or Semitic branches. Additionally, Omotic languages are spoken by ethnic minority groups inhabiting the southern regions. Nilo-Saharan languages are also spoken by the nation's Nilotic ethnic minorities. Oromo is the most populous language by native speakers, while Amharic is the most populous by number of total speakers and serves as the working language in the federal government. Ge'ez remains important as a liturgical language for both the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church and for the Beta Israel.
The nation is a land of natural contrasts, with its vast fertile west, its forests and its numerous rivers, and the world's hottest settlement of Dallol in its north. The Ethiopian Highlands are the largest continuous mountain ranges in Africa, and the Sof Omar Caves contains the largest cave on the continent. Ethiopia also has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. Additionally, the sovereign state is a founding member of the UN, the Group of 24 (G-24), the Non-Aligned Movement, the G77 and the Organisation of African Unity. Its capital city, Addis Ababa, serves as the headquarters of the African Union, the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Standby Force and many of the global NGOs focused on Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, Ethiopia experienced civil conflicts and communist purges, which hindered its economy. The country has since recovered and as of 2010 has the largest economy (by GDP) in East Africa, having the largest population in the region. Despite these improvements, it remains one of the world's poorest countries. In addition to poverty, Ethiopia faces hunger, corruption, weak infrastructure, and poor respect for human rights and access to health and education (with an illiteracy rate of 51%), ranking in the worst quartile on the Human Development Index.","{7, 2058, 1036, 14, 1555, 1058, 3621, 1584, 563, 4661, 2104, 1084, 4671, 2112, 575, 580, 586, 1622, 2141, 4192, 98, 2150, 3174, 2152, 3690, 2157, 1646, 3693, 1649, 1139, 2169, 3195, 127, 640, 2703, 3727, 1170, 4756, 4768, 1703, 2215, 2216, 3752, 3243, 4775, 1197, 174, 1709, 4785, 1207, 703, 3777, 1731, 718, 208, 4307, 3803, 1244, 4829, 1248, 3301, 3813, 3308, 1783, 3322, 257, 3842, 4871, 4879, 272, 785, 794, 4895, 1824, 802, 3874, 805, 4915, 310, 3385, 4923, 3903, 1857, 1861, 2379, 4940, 847, 2388, 3413, 1888, 1890, 4971, 1908, 889, 890, 3451, 4993, 4994, 3459, 900, 2955, 3979, 3980, 3989, 5019, 3490, 3495, 1960, 2475, 4526, 4017, 2483, 4020, 4024, 1979, 452, 964, 3524, 1997, 463, 4051, 2004, 4563, 5077, 3034, 1502, 3564, 4589, 494, 2036, 1017, 3578, 4605}",133,"['Ethiopia', '3,000 years', 'Ethiopia', 'ʾĪtyōṗṗyā', 'Somali', 'the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia', 'the Horn of Africa', 'Eritrea', 'Djibouti', 'Somalia', 'Kenya', 'South Sudan', 'Sudan', '2019', 'Ethiopia', 'African', 'Addis Ababa', 'the East African Rift', 'Nubian', 'Somali', 'Ethiopia', 'the Middle East', 'Afroasiatic', 'Horn', 'Ethiopia', 'the Solomonic dynasty', 'the Queen of Sheba', 'Menelik I.', 'the first centuries', 'the Kingdom of Aksum', 'Ethiopian', 'the late–19th-century', 'Africa', 'Ethiopia', 'Liberia', 'European', 'Italy', '1936', 'Italian', 'Ethiopia', 'Italian', 'East Africa', 'World War II', 'Italian', 'centuries', 'Ethiopia', 'African', 'the 20th-century', 'League of Nations', 'the United Nations', '1974', 'Ethiopian', 'Haile Selassie', 'Derg', 'communist', 'the Soviet Union', '1987', 'Derg', ""the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"", '1991', ""the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front"", 'Ethiopia', 'Eritrea', 'Ethiopian', 'approximately seven years and three months', 'Gregorian', 'Christianity', 'the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church', ""P'ent'ay"", 'Kingdom of Aksum', 'Islam', 'Sunni', 'Abyssinia', 'Muslim', 'Africa', 'Negash', 'Ethiopian', 'Jews', 'Bete Israel', 'Ethiopia', 'the 1980s', 'Ethiopia', 'Oromo', 'Amhara', 'Somali', 'Tigrayans', 'Afroasiatic', 'Cushitic', 'Semitic', 'Nilo-Saharan', 'Nilotic', 'Oromo', 'Amharic', 'the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church', 'the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church', 'the Beta Israel', 'Dallol', 'The Ethiopian Highlands', 'Africa', 'Ethiopia', 'UNESCO World Heritage Sites', 'Africa', 'UN', 'Group of 24', 'the Non-Aligned Movement', 'G77', 'the Organisation of African Unity', 'Addis Ababa', 'the African Union', 'the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry', 'the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa', 'the African Standby Force', 'Africa', 'the 1970s and 1980s', 'Ethiopia', 'communist', '2010', 'East Africa', 'Ethiopia', '51%']","['GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERCENT']"

The event marked the end of the Vietnam War and the start of a transition period to the formal reunification of Vietnam into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.The PAVN, under the command of General Văn Tiến Dũng, began their final attack on Saigon on April 29, 1975, with the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces commanded by General Nguyễn Văn Toàn suffering a heavy artillery bombardment. By the afternoon of the next day, the PAVN had occupied the important points of the city and raised their flag over the South Vietnamese presidential palace. The city was renamed Hồ Chí Minh City, after the late North Vietnamese President Hồ Chí Minh.
The capture of the city was preceded by Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of almost all the American civilian and military personnel in Saigon, along with tens of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians who had been associated with the southern regime.A few Americans chose not to be evacuated. US ground combat units had left South Vietnam more than two years prior to the fall of Saigon and were not available to assist with either the defense of Saigon or the evacuation. The evacuation was the largest helicopter evacuation in history. In addition to the flight of refugees, the end of the war and the institution of new rules by the communists contributed to a decline in the city's population.","{1026, 2568, 521, 3083, 528, 4113, 3090, 1562, 2589, 1566, 1058, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 3630, 1584, 4661, 2104, 1081, 2112, 3648, 3139, 1622, 2649, 2652, 4192, 2152, 3195, 127, 2176, 4235, 144, 3734, 154, 2213, 3243, 4268, 1709, 1711, 3777, 4807, 3804, 3805, 3813, 748, 1783, 1272, 2297, 1275, 771, 3332, 4871, 1292, 4895, 1319, 4905, 302, 4400, 1341, 4413, 3903, 1857, 4941, 3413, 4437, 1890, 1386, 4990, 4994, 3459, 3979, 401, 5010, 5037, 4526, 2483, 1979, 5059, 452, 964, 3524, 5067, 2508, 1997, 4558, 2004, 5079, 3034, 478, 492, 2039}",92,"['Vietnam', 'US', 'Saigon', 'North Vietnamese', 'US', 'Fall of Saigon', 'the Liberation of Saigon', 'Saigon', 'South Vietnam', ""the People's Army"", 'Vietnam', 'PAVN', 'the Viet Cong', '30 April 1975', 'the Vietnam War', 'Vietnam', 'the Socialist Republic of Vietnam', 'PAVN', 'Văn Tiến Dũng', 'Saigon', 'April 29, 1975', 'the Army of the Republic of Vietnam', 'ARVN', 'Nguyễn Văn Toàn', 'PAVN', 'South Vietnamese', 'Hồ Chí Minh City', 'North Vietnamese', 'Hồ Chí Minh', 'American', 'Saigon', 'South Vietnamese', 'Americans', 'US', 'South Vietnam', 'more than two years', 'Saigon', 'Saigon']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE']"

244,1975,January,6,"""Wheel Of Fortune"" debuts on NBC-TV",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_(American_game_show),"Wheel of Fortune (often known simply as Wheel) is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin that debuted in 1975. The show features a competition in which contestants solve word puzzles, similar to those used in Hangman, to win cash and prizes determined by spinning a giant carnival wheel.
Wheel originally aired as a daytime series on NBC from January 6, 1975, to June 30, 1989. After some changes were made to its format, the daytime series moved to CBS from July 17, 1989, to January 11, 1991. It then returned to NBC from January 14, 1991, until it was cancelled on September 20, 1991. The popularity of the daytime series led to a nightly syndicated edition being developed, which premiered on September 19, 1983, and has aired continuously since.
The network version was originally hosted by Chuck Woolery and Susan Stafford, with Charlie O'Donnell as its announcer. O'Donnell left in 1980 and was replaced by Jack Clark. After Clark's death in 1988, M. G. Kelly took over briefly as announcer until O'Donnell returned in 1989. O'Donnell remained on the network version until its cancellation, and continued to announce on the syndicated show until his death in 2010, when Jim Thornton succeeded him. Woolery left in 1981, and was replaced by Pat Sajak. Sajak left the network version in January 1989 to host his own late-night talk show, and was replaced on that version by Rolf Benirschke. Bob Goen replaced Benirschke when the network show moved to CBS, then remained as host until the network show was canceled altogether. Stafford left in 1982, and was replaced by Vanna White, who remained on the network show for the rest of its run. The syndicated version has been hosted continuously by Sajak and White since its inception.
Wheel of Fortune ranks as the longest-running syndicated game show in the United States, with 7,000 episodes taped and aired as of May 10, 2019. TV Guide named it the ""top-rated syndicated series"" in a 2008 article, and in 2013, the magazine ranked it at No. 2 in its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever. The program has also come to gain a worldwide following with sixty international adaptations. The syndicated series' 37th season premiered on September 9, 2019, and Sajak became the longest-running host of any game show, surpassing Bob Barker, who hosted The Price Is Right from 1972 to 2007.","{4611, 7, 2568, 1049, 4134, 1576, 2096, 4671, 1095, 2122, 4682, 4683, 4174, 3154, 595, 3666, 1622, 2152, 3180, 1133, 1649, 3702, 2169, 2171, 128, 640, 2703, 3727, 4758, 157, 4768, 2210, 4770, 4775, 1706, 173, 717, 4815, 3795, 4307, 4824, 4825, 3803, 744, 748, 3322, 3842, 1795, 4895, 290, 2342, 4905, 4400, 4402, 1847, 4920, 826, 2875, 2388, 3927, 1888, 4971, 1908, 889, 4474, 3451, 4986, 4990, 895, 4993, 3970, 3459, 903, 2955, 3989, 1432, 4007, 5033, 4024, 1979, 4539, 4549, 1990, 967, 971, 2507, 4561, 5074, 5077, 2529, 2018, 997, 4589}",93,"['NBC-TV', 'Fortune', 'American', 'Merv Griffin', '1975', 'Hangman', 'NBC', 'January 6, 1975', 'June 30, 1989', 'CBS', 'July 17, 1989, to January 11, 1991', 'NBC', 'January 14, 1991', 'September 20, 1991', 'September 19, 1983', 'Chuck Woolery', 'Susan Stafford', ""Charlie O'Donnell"", ""O'Donnell"", '1980', 'Jack Clark', 'Clark', '1988', 'M.

246,1975,March,7,"""Mirror"", Russian film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, starring Margarita Terekhova and Ignat Daniltsev, is released",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_(1975_film),"Mirror (Russian: Зеркало, romanized: Zerkalo; known in the United States as The Mirror) is a 1975 Russian art film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. It is loosely autobiographical, unconventionally structured, and incorporates poems composed and read by the director's father, Arseny Tarkovsky. The film features Margarita Terekhova, Ignat Daniltsev, Alla Demidova, Anatoly Solonitsyn, Tarkovsky's wife Larisa Tarkovskaya and his mother Maria Vishnyakova. Innokenty Smoktunovsky provides voiceover and Eduard Artemyev the incidental music and sound effects.
Mirror is structured in the form of a nonlinear narrative, with its main concept dating back to 1964 and undergoing multiple scripted versions by Tarkovsky and Aleksandr Misharin. It unfolds around memories recalled by a dying poet of key moments in his life and in Soviet culture. The film combines contemporary scenes with childhood memories, dreams, and newsreel footage. Its cinematography slips between color, black-and-white, and sepia. The film's loose flow of visually oneiric images has been compared with the stream of consciousness technique in modernist literature.
Mirror initially polarized critics and audiences, with many considering its narrative to be incomprehensible. The work has grown in reputation since its release, and ranked nineteenth in Sight & Sound's 2012 critics' poll of the best films ever made, and ninth in the directors' poll. It has also found favor with many Russians for whom it remains their most beloved of Tarkovsky's works.","{640, 4993, 3842, 3459, 3332, 4994, 7, 2955, 4235, 2703, 3727, 5008, 3989, 3613, 1566, 4895, 1824, 4768, 290, 1058, 2210, 3365, 4134, 4905, 2171, 1584, 4785, 182, 2104, 1979, 2875, 4413, 4539, 3520, 3777, 452, 580, 964, 1095, 4549, 4682, 971, 2507, 1997, 3322, 4944, 595, 2004, 2388, 1622, 3795, 4307, 5077, 4445, 4829, 889, 4192, 358, 2150, 2152, 5097, 4971, 4589, 1649, 498, 1783, 2169, 3578, 3451, 4605}",70,"['Mirror', 'Russian', 'Andrei Tarkovsky', 'Margarita Terekhova', 'Ignat Daniltsev', 'Russian', 'Зеркало', 'Zerkalo', 'the United States', '1975', 'Russian', 'Andrei Tarkovsky', 'Arseny Tarkovsky', 'Margarita Terekhova', 'Ignat Daniltsev', 'Anatoly Solonitsyn', 'Tarkovsky', 'Larisa Tarkovskaya', 'Maria Vishnyakova', 'Smoktunovsky', 'Eduard Artemyev', '1964', 'Tarkovsky', 'Aleksandr Misharin', 'Soviet', ""Sight & Sound's"", '2012', 'Russians', 'Tarkovsky']","['ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE']"

Use of a VCR to record a  television program to play back at a more convenient time is commonly referred to as timeshifting. VCRs can also play back prerecorded tapes. In the 1980s and 1990s, prerecorded videotapes were widely available for purchase and rental, and blank tapes were sold to make recordings. 
Most domestic VCRs are equipped with a television broadcast receiver (tuner) for TV reception, and a programmable clock (timer) for unattended recording of a television channel from a start time to an end time specified by the user. These features began as simple mechanical counter-based single-event timers, but were later replaced by more flexible multiple-event digital clock timers. In later models the multiple timer events could be programmed through a menu interface displayed on the playback TV screen (""on-screen display"" or OSD). This feature allowed several programs to be recorded at different times without further user intervention, and became a major selling point.","{3842, 4134, 7, 4971, 4589, 4307, 4024, 889, 3322, 3451, 3199}",11,"['Sony', 'Betamax', 'VCRs', 'the 1980s and 1990s']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE']"

Based on material Pink Floyd composed while performing in Europe, Wish You Were Here was recorded over numerous sessions throughout 1975 at Abbey Road Studios in London.
The album's themes include criticism of the music business, alienation, and a tribute to founding member Syd Barrett, who left seven years earlier with deteriorating mental health. Like their previous record, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink Floyd used studio effects and synthesisers. Guest singers included Roy Harper, who provided the lead vocals on ""Have a Cigar"", and Venetta Fields, who added backing vocals to ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"". To promote the album, the band released the double A-side single ""Have a Cigar"" / ""Welcome to the Machine"".
Wish You Were Here received mixed reviews from critics on its release, who found its music to be uninspiring and inferior to their previous work. It has retrospectively received critical acclaim, hailed as one of the greatest albums of all time and was cited by keyboardist Richard Wright and guitarist David Gilmour as their favourite Pink Floyd album.

250,1975,October,19,"""A Chorus Line"", held record longest-running Broadway show (6,137 performances), premieres on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre in New York",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre,"Musical theatre is a form of theatrical performance that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting and dance. The story and emotional content of a musical – humor, pathos, love, anger – are communicated through words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals.
Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America. These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan at the turn of the 20th century. The Princess Theatre musicals (1915–1918) and other smart shows like Of Thee I Sing (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as Show Boat (1927) and Oklahoma! (1943).  Some of the most famous musicals through the decades that followed include
West Side Story (1957), The Fantasticks (1960), Hair (1967), A Chorus Line (1975), Les Misérables (1985), The Phantom of the Opera (1986), Rent (1996), The Producers (2001), Wicked (2003) and Hamilton (2015).
Musicals are performed around the world. They may be presented in large venues, such as big-budget Broadway or West End productions in New York City or London. Alternatively, musicals may be staged in smaller venues, such as fringe theatre, Off-Broadway, Off-Off-Broadway, regional theatre, or community theatre productions, or on tour.

251,1975,November,6,"First performance of the Sex Pistols at St Martins College, London",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Pistols,"The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band that formed in London in 1975. They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians. Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, they are regarded as one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music.The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten (John Lydon), guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock. Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977. Under the management of Malcolm McLaren, the band attracted controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain. Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single ""God Save the Queen"", attacking Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, they precipitated the punk rock movement.
In January 1978, at the end of an over-hyped and turbulent tour of the United States, Rotten announced the band's break-up. Over the next few months, the three remaining band members recorded songs for McLaren's film version of the Sex Pistols' story, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979, following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend.
Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock briefly reunited for a concert tour in 1996. On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistols—the four original members plus Vicious—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but they refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum ""a piss stain"".","{640, 4993, 3842, 3459, 3970, 7, 4235, 2703, 1168, 3727, 1170, 1555, 4879, 3989, 1275, 1566, 4895, 4768, 290, 1699, 2210, 3365, 4134, 4642, 1576, 4905, 46, 1454, 310, 4407, 4024, 1465, 4536, 2875, 4539, 4413, 452, 4549, 967, 1095, 2122, 971, 4940, 1483, 2379, 4815, 2507, 2891, 336, 4682, 3154, 595, 3451, 3795, 1622, 3927, 4307, 5077, 889, 607, 3046, 2152, 2153, 4971, 3180, 4589, 1649, 1780, 3322, 2169, 4474, 2171, 4605}",73,"['the Sex Pistols at St Martins College', 'London', 'The Sex Pistols', 'English', 'London', '1975', 'the United Kingdom', 'Never Mind the Bollocks', 'the Sex Pistols', 'The Sex Pistols', 'Johnny Rotten', 'John Lydon', 'Steve Jones', 'Paul Cook', 'Glen Matlock', 'Matlock', 'Sid Vicious', 'early 1977', 'Malcolm McLaren', 'Britain', 'December 1976', 'May 1977', 'Britons', 'Crown', 'January 1978', 'the United States', 'the next few months', 'McLaren', ""The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle"", 'February 1979', 'Jones', 'Cook', 'Matlock', '1996', '24 February 2006', 'the Sex Pistols', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'LANGUAGE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG']"
252,1975,April,3,Bobby Fischer stripped of world chess title for refusing to defend it,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship,"The World Chess Championship is played to determine the world champion in chess. Since 2014, the schedule has settled on a two-year cycle with a championship held in every even year. Magnus Carlsen has been world champion since he defeated Viswanathan Anand in 2013. He successfully defended the title in 2014, 2016 and 2018, and is next due to defend the title in late 2020.
The official world championship is generally regarded to have begun in 1886, when the two leading players in the world, Wilhelm Steinitz and Johann Zukertort, played a match, which was won by Steinitz. From 1886 to 1946, the champion set the terms, requiring any challenger to raise a sizable stake and defeat the champion in a match in order to become the new world champion. From 1948 to 1993, the championship was administered by FIDE, the World Chess Federation. In 1993, reigning champion Garry Kasparov broke away from FIDE, which led to the creation of the rival Professional Chess Association (PCA) championship. The titles were unified at the World Chess Championship 2006, and since 2006 the championship has again been administered by FIDE.
Though the world championship is open to all players, there are separate events and titles for the Women's World Chess Championship, the World Junior Chess Championship (for players under 20 years of age, though there are younger age events also), and the World Senior Chess Championship (for men above 60 years of age, and women above 50). There are also faster time limit events, the World Rapid Chess Championship and the World Blitz Chess Championship. The World Computer Chess Championship is open to computer chess programs and hardware.","{640, 4993, 1026, 387, 900, 2051, 3842, 7, 4994, 2955, 1678, 2703, 3727, 3862, 1177, 4768, 4134, 2483, 2104, 4024, 2875, 4539, 452, 4549, 967, 2122, 1739, 1228, 2379, 2507, 4815, 2891, 3322, 4430, 4682, 467, 595, 981, 1622, 2388, 2391, 4051, 4307, 3803, 4825, 2141, 1502, 1888, 889, 1890, 3812, 3813, 744, 873, 3434, 620, 1388, 1646, 4078, 3952, 1649, 4474, 4589, 4722, 3190, 2169, 2682, 3451, 4605, 890, 127}",71,"['Bobby Fischer', 'The World Chess Championship', '2014', 'two-year', 'every even year', 'Magnus Carlsen', 'Viswanathan Anand', '2013', '2014', '2016', '2018', '2020', '1886', 'Wilhelm Steinitz', 'Johann Zukertort', 'Steinitz', '1886 to 1946', '1948 to 1993', 'FIDE', 'the World Chess Federation', '1993', 'Garry Kasparov', 'FIDE', 'Professional Chess Association', 'the World Chess Championship 2006', '2006', 'FIDE', ""the Women's World Chess Championship"", 'the World Junior Chess Championship', 'under 20 years of age', 'the World Senior Chess Championship', '60 years of age', 'the World Rapid Chess Championship', 'the World Blitz Chess Championship', 'The World Computer Chess Championship']","['PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG']"
253,1975,October,1,"""The Thrilla in Manila""; Muhammad Ali stops Joe Frazier in 14 rounds in Quezon City, the Philippines to retain his WBC/WBA heavyweight title",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Frazier,"Joseph William Frazier (January 12, 1944 – November 7, 2011), nicknamed ""Smokin' Joe"", was an American professional boxer who competed from 1965 to 1981. He reigned as the undisputed heavyweight champion from 1970 to 1973, and as an amateur won a gold medal at the 1964 Summer Olympics. Frazier was known for his strength, durability, formidable punching power, and relentless pressure fighting style. He was also the first boxer to beat Muhammad Ali.
Frazier emerged as the top contender in the late 1960s, defeating opponents that included Jerry Quarry, Oscar Bonavena, Buster Mathis, Eddie Machen, Doug Jones, George Chuvalo, and Jimmy Ellis en route to becoming undisputed heavyweight champion in 1970, and followed up by defeating Muhammad Ali by unanimous decision in the highly anticipated Fight of the Century in 1971. Two years later, Frazier lost his title when he was defeated by George Foreman. He fought on, beating Joe Bugner, losing a rematch to Ali and then beating Quarry and Ellis again.
Frazier's last world title challenge came in 1975, but he was beaten by Ali in their brutal rubber match, the Thrilla in Manila. He retired in 1976 following a second loss to Foreman. He made a comeback in 1981, fighting just once before retiring for good, finishing his career with a record of 32 wins, 4 losses and 1 draw. The International Boxing Research Organization rates Frazier among the ten greatest heavyweights of all time. The Ring magazine named him Fighter of the Year in 1967, 1970 and 1971, while the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) named him Fighter of the Year in 1969, 1971 and 1975. In 1999, The Ring magazine ranked him the eighth greatest heavyweight. BoxRec ranks him as the 18th greatest heavyweight of all time.  He is an inductee of both the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame.
Frazier's style was often compared to that of Henry Armstrong and occasionally Rocky Marciano, dependent on bobbing, weaving and relentless pressure to wear down his opponents. His best-known punch was a powerful left hook, which accounted for most of his knockouts. In his career, he lost to only two fighters, both former Olympic and world heavyweight champions: twice to Muhammad Ali, and twice to George Foreman.
After retiring, Frazier made cameo appearances in several Hollywood movies and two episodes of The Simpsons. His son Marvis became a boxer—trained by Frazier himself—but Marvis was knocked out in the first round by an up-and-coming Mike Tyson in 1986, with Marvis ending his career with a record of 19 wins and 2 losses. Joe's daughter Jacqui Frazier-Lyde also boxed professionally and is a former WIBA world light-heavyweight champion, ending her career with a record of 13 wins and 1 loss, with her sole loss coming in a majority decision points loss to Laila Ali, the daughter of Muhammad Ali, in a fight dubbed as ""Ali–Frazier IV"". Joe Frazier continued to train fighters in his gym in Philadelphia. His attitude towards Muhammad Ali in later life was largely characterized by bitterness and contempt, interspersed with brief reconciliations.
Frazier was diagnosed with liver cancer in late September 2011 and admitted to hospice care. He died of complications from the disease on November 7, 2011.",{4741},1,"['Thrilla', 'Manila', 'Muhammad Ali', 'Joe Frazier', 'Quezon City', 'Philippines', 'WBC', 'WBA', 'Joseph William Frazier', 'January 12, 1944', 'November 7, 2011', ""Smokin' Joe"", 'American', '1965 to 1981', '1970 to 1973', 'the 1964 Summer Olympics', 'Muhammad Ali', 'the late 1960s', 'Jerry Quarry', 'Oscar Bonavena', 'Buster Mathis', 'Eddie Machen', 'Doug Jones', 'George Chuvalo', 'Jimmy Ellis', '1970', 'Muhammad Ali', 'Fight of', 'the Century in 1971', 'Two years later', 'Frazier', 'George Foreman', 'Joe Bugner', 'Ali', 'Quarry', 'Ellis', '1975', 'Ali', 'Thrilla', 'Manila', '1976', 'Foreman', '1981', 'The International Boxing Research Organization', 'Frazier', 'Ring', 'Fighter', 'the Year in 1967,', '1970', '1971', 'the Boxing Writers Association of America', 'Fighter', 'the Year in 1969, 1971 and', '1975', '1999', 'The Ring', 'BoxRec', 'the International Boxing Hall of Fame', 'the World Boxing Hall of Fame', 'Frazier', 'Henry Armstrong', 'Rocky Marciano', 'Olympic', 'Muhammad Ali', 'George Foreman', 'Frazier', 'Hollywood', 'Marvis', 'Frazier', 'Marvis', 'Mike Tyson', '1986', 'Marvis', 'Joe', 'Jacqui Frazier-Lyde', 'WIBA', 'Laila Ali', 'Muhammad Ali', 'Ali', 'Joe Frazier', 'Philadelphia', 'Muhammad Ali', 'November 7, 2011']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"

He was known for performing in the Allman Brothers Band. Allman grew up with an interest in rhythm and blues music, and the Allman Brothers Band fused it with rock music, jazz, and country at times. He wrote several of the band's biggest songs, including ""Whipping Post"", ""Melissa"", and ""Midnight Rider"". Allman also had a successful solo career, releasing seven studio albums. He was born and spent much of his childhood in Nashville, Tennessee, before relocating to Daytona Beach, Florida and then Richmond Hill, Georgia.
He and his brother, Duane Allman, formed the Allman Brothers Band in 1969, which reached mainstream success with their 1971 live album At Fillmore East. Shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash. The band continued, with Brothers and Sisters (1973) their most successful album. Allman began a solo career with Laid Back the same year, and was perhaps most famous for his marriage to pop star Cher for the rest of the decade. He had an unexpected late career hit with his cover of the song ""I'm No Angel"" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, Low Country Blues (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career. Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance abuse, which formed the basis of his memoir My Cross to Bear (2012). His final album, Southern Blood, was released posthumously on September 8, 2017.
Allman performed with a Hammond organ and guitar, and was recognized for his soulful voice. For his work in music, Allman was referred to as a Southern rock pioneer and received numerous awards, including one Grammy Award; he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.

She was the third wife of President Juan Perón. During her husband's third term as president from 1973 to 1974, Isabel served as both vice president and First Lady. Following her husband's death in office in 1974, Isabel served as president of Argentina from 1 July 1974 to 24 March 1976, at which time the military took over the government and placed her under house arrest for five years, before exiling her to Spain in 1981. She holds the distinction of having been the first woman to have had the title of ""President"", as opposed to a queen or prime minister.
In 2007 an Argentine judge ordered her arrest over the forced disappearance of an activist in February 1976, on the grounds that the disappearance was authorized by her signing of decrees allowing Argentina's armed forces to take action against ""subversives"".

261,1976,April,1,"Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs found Apple Computer in the garage of Jobs' parents house in Cupertino, California",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs,"Steven Paul Jobs (; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. His declassified FBI report states that he used marijuana and LSD while he was in college, and once told a reporter that taking LSD was ""one of the two or three most important things"" he had done in his life.
Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple's members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated film Toy Story (1995).
Apple acquired NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few months. He was largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been at the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the ""Think different"" advertising campaign and leading to the iMac, iTunes, iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with a completely new Mac OS X, based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor at age 56 on October 5, 2011.","{1025, 2051, 901, 523, 1938, 1555, 20, 5022, 3998, 2210, 4134, 4007, 2995, 1847, 1591, 4920, 311, 1990, 967, 968, 2507, 4815, 2258, 595, 3154, 5074, 2141, 607, 608, 2018, 997, 874, 3180, 4589, 370, 4981}",36,"['Steve Wozniak', 'Steve Jobs', 'Apple Computer', 'Cupertino', 'California', 'Steven Paul Jobs', 'February 24, 1955', 'October 5, 2011', 'American', 'Apple Inc.', 'Pixar', ""The Walt Disney Company's"", 'Pixar', 'NeXT', 'Jobs', '1970s', '1980s', 'Apple', 'Steve Wozniak', 'San Francisco', 'California', 'the San Francisco Bay Area', 'Reed College', '1972', 'India', '1974', 'Zen Buddhism', 'FBI', 'marijuana', 'LSD', 'Wozniak co-', 'Apple', '1976', 'Wozniak', 'Apple', 'a year later', 'the Apple II', 'the Xerox Alto', '1979', 'Apple Lisa', '1983', 'Macintosh', '1984', 'Macintosh', '1985', 'the Apple LaserWriter', 'Jobs', 'Apple', '1985', 'John Sculley', 'That same year', 'Jobs', 'Apple', 'NeXT', ""George Lucas's"", 'Lucasfilm', '1986', 'Pixar', '3D', 'Toy Story', '1995', 'Apple', 'NeXT', '1997', 'Jobs', 'a few months', 'Apple', 'Jony', '1997', 'iMac', 'iTunes', 'iPod', 'iPhone', 'App Store', 'iPad', '2001', 'Mac OS', 'Mac OS X', 'NeXT', 'Jobs', '2003', 'age 56', 'October 5, 2011']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE']"

Since retiring as a full-time host and contributor, she continued to occasionally report for ABC News through 2015.Walters began her career on The Today Show in the early 1960s as a writer and segment producer of women's interest stories. Her popularity with viewers resulted in Walters receiving more airtime, and in 1974 she became co-host of the program, the first woman to hold such a title on an American news program. In 1976, she continued to be a pioneer for women in broadcasting by becoming the first female co-anchor of a network evening news program, alongside Harry Reasoner on the ABC Evening News. From 1979 to 2004, Walters worked as a producer and co-host on the ABC newsmagazine 20/20. She also became known for an annual special aired on ABC, Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People.
Walters also created, produced, and co-hosted the ABC daytime talk show The View, on which she appeared from 1997 until her retirement in 2014. Thereafter, she continued to host a number of special reports for 20/20 as well as documentary series for Investigation Discovery.

Earthquake prediction is sometimes distinguished from earthquake forecasting, which can be defined as the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazard, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades. Prediction can be further distinguished from earthquake warning systems, which upon detection of an earthquake, provide a real-time warning of seconds to neighboring regions that might be affected.
In the 1970s, scientists were optimistic that a practical method for predicting earthquakes would soon be found, but by the 1990s continuing failure led many to question whether it was even possible.  Demonstrably successful predictions of large earthquakes have not occurred and the few claims of success are controversial. For example, the most famous claim of a successful prediction is that alleged for the 1975 Haicheng earthquake. A later study said that there was no valid short-term prediction. Extensive searches have reported many possible earthquake precursors, but, so far, such precursors have not been reliably identified across significant spatial and temporal scales. While part of the scientific community hold that, taking into account non-seismic precursors and given enough resources to study them extensively, prediction might be possible, most scientists are pessimistic and some maintain that earthquake prediction is inherently impossible.","{4611, 1540, 3598, 4113, 3601, 28, 3612, 3109, 563, 4661, 2104, 1081, 1095, 586, 2640, 2645, 2137, 620, 2157, 1646, 3692, 1651, 2679, 632, 3705, 127, 3199, 3724, 1678, 1683, 1177, 1193, 3243, 1709, 4785, 3252, 698, 4286, 2763, 4307, 2261, 4829, 3813, 3303, 239, 1266, 762, 1291, 1803, 795, 810, 302, 4917, 1334, 2368, 2884, 843, 2891, 4430, 4942, 2899, 2388, 3413, 3927, 1370, 2908, 1890, 1386, 4971, 1907, 375, 892, 4477, 893, 2435, 1931, 3979, 4496, 2964, 3481, 3482, 5019, 3489, 1960, 2984, 5037, 4526, 2483, 442, 1979, 5052, 4547, 452, 3524, 1486, 2514, 4074, 495, 1008, 5107, 1017}",101,"['Tangshan Earthquake', 'Northern China', 'the 20th century', 'years', 'decades', 'the 1970s', '1990s', '1975', 'Haicheng']","['PERSON', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE']"

Zhongnanhai houses the office of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (paramount leader) and Premier of the People's Republic of China.
The term Zhongnanhai is closely linked with the central government and senior Communist Party officials. It is often used as a metonym for the Chinese leadership at large (in the same sense that the term ""White House"" refers to the U.S. executive branch). The state leaders, including Xi Jinping, current General Secretary of the Communist Party, and other top CPC and PRC leadership figures carry out many of their day-to-day administrative activities inside the compound, such as meetings with foreign dignitaries. China Central Television frequently shows footage of meetings inside the compound, but limits its coverage largely to views of the interior of buildings.
After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong received many important foreign leaders in Zhongnanhai, including Nikita Khrushchev, Che Guevara, Richard Nixon, Georges Pompidou, Kakuei Tanaka and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, among others. Mao's favorite places in Zhongnanhai were the Library of Chrysanthemum Fragrance (his personal residence, filled with bookshelves) and the Poolside House, next to the large indoor swimming pool, where he would spend much of the day swimming or reading books and reports by the pool. After Mao's death, the Chrysanthemum Library along with many of his belongings was preserved as a museum which is not accessible to the general public.","{2563, 6, 2055, 520, 3080, 4614, 523, 3597, 1555, 4630, 1559, 2584, 4123, 540, 541, 2080, 3110, 3113, 3625, 1583, 561, 2614, 4154, 4679, 2122, 4171, 4682, 1613, 595, 4691, 2140, 606, 1631, 3167, 3678, 4704, 4706, 4199, 1640, 3180, 110, 2159, 1136, 1142, 1658, 637, 128, 4736, 2179, 3205, 4230, 4750, 1167, 1682, 4756, 1688, 2712, 4768, 2721, 680, 2217, 2729, 175, 687, 1206, 702, 4798, 4800, 202, 3278, 4815, 3795, 4307, 1237, 214, 1238, 730, 3299, 3812, 743, 1255, 234, 2794, 3309, 756, 757, 1780, 4853, 2306, 3842, 1804, 4367, 273, 4882, 3348, 2839, 794, 4379, 4890, 286, 2337, 1314, 3877, 2854, 3879, 810, 1330, 4914, 1849, 832, 3395, 4936, 1865, 2896, 1369, 1372, 861, 3932, 2400, 873, 4971, 1388, 2413, 2415, 3951, 2929, 3442, 1908, 3957, 4981, 4983, 1914, 4474, 1404, 895, 4480, 3457, 386, 3970, 1925, 1414, 391, 4489, 2443, 4498, 3998, 944, 2997, 5046, 5047, 5050, 4539, 1985, 4549, 5062, 967, 971, 2507, 2509, 5074, 5077, 3542, 2520, 4571, 4575, 2529, 2018, 2531, 4589, 1518, 3572, 1526, 504, 4601, 2044, 3581, 3582}",177,"[""Mao Zedong's"", 'Beijing', 'Zhongnanhai', 'Chinese', 'the Imperial City', 'Beijing', 'the Forbidden City', 'the Communist Party of China', 'the State Council', 'China', 'Zhongnanhai', 'the Communist Party of China', ""the People's Republic of China"", 'Zhongnanhai', 'Communist Party', 'Chinese', 'White House', 'U.S.', 'Xi Jinping', 'the Communist Party', 'CPC', 'PRC', 'day', 'China Central Television', ""the People's Republic of China"", '1949', 'Mao Zedong', 'Zhongnanhai', 'Nikita Khrushchev', 'Che Guevara', 'Richard Nixon', 'Georges Pompidou', 'Kakuei Tanaka', 'Zulfikar Ali Bhutto', 'Mao', 'Zhongnanhai', 'the Poolside House', 'the day swimming', 'Mao', 'the Chrysanthemum Library']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG']"
266,1976,December,2,"Fidel Castro becomes President of Cuba, replacing Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro,"Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz (American Spanish: [fiˈðel aleˈxandɾo ˈkastɾo ˈrus]; 13 August 1926 – 25 November 2016) was a Cuban communist revolutionary politician, a Marxist–Leninist and Cuban nationalist. Castro governed the Republic of Cuba as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1961 until 2011, Prime Minister from 1959 to 1976 and then as President of the Council of State and Council of Ministers from 1976 to 2008. Castro also served as the Commander-in-chief of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces. Under his administration, Cuba became a one-party communist state, while industry and business were nationalized and state socialist policies were implemented throughout society.
Born in Birán, Oriente as the son of a wealthy Spanish farmer, Castro adopted leftist anti-imperialist ideas while studying law at the University of Havana. After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, he planned the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953. After a year's imprisonment, Castro traveled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group, the 26th of July Movement, with his brother Raúl Castro and Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. Returning to Cuba, Castro took a key role in the Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista's forces from the Sierra Maestra. After Batista's overthrow in 1959, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's Prime Minister. The United States came to oppose Castro's government and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination, economic blockade, and counter-revolution, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961. Countering these threats, Castro aligned with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba, resulting in the Cuban Missile Crisis – a defining incident of the Cold War – in 1962.
Adopting a Marxist–Leninist model of development, Castro converted Cuba into a one-party, socialist state under Communist Party rule, the first in the Western Hemisphere. Policies introducing central economic planning and expanding healthcare and education were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression of internal dissent. Abroad, Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary groups, backing the establishment of Marxist governments in Chile, Nicaragua, and Grenada, as well as sending troops to aid allies in the Yom Kippur, Ogaden, and Angolan Civil War. These actions, coupled with Castro's leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1979 to 1983 and Cuba's medical internationalism, increased Cuba's profile on the world stage. Following the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991, Castro led Cuba through the economic downturn of the ""Special Period"", embracing environmentalist and anti-globalization ideas. In the 2000s, Castro forged alliances in the Latin American ""pink tide"" – namely with Hugo Chávez's Venezuela – and signed Cuba up to the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. In 2006, Castro transferred his responsibilities to Vice President Raúl Castro, who was elected to the presidency by the National Assembly in 2008.
The longest-serving non-royal head of state in the 20th and 21st centuries, Castro polarized opinion throughout the world. His supporters view him as a champion of socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary regime advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba's independence from US hegemony. Critics view him as a tyrannical dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses, the exodus of a large number of Cubans, and the impoverishment of the country's economy. Castro was decorated with various international awards and significantly influenced different individuals and groups across the world.","{4611, 2051, 1540, 7, 2568, 521, 524, 3598, 528, 3601, 3090, 3091, 4113, 1049, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1566, 1569, 4642, 3109, 4134, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4647, 2096, 3632, 4661, 2104, 1081, 3137, 2628, 70, 1095, 2122, 4174, 4688, 593, 3154, 595, 1622, 2649, 2652, 2141, 608, 1121, 3686, 2152, 2155, 620, 1133, 1646, 2157, 1136, 1649, 1651, 3190, 2679, 2169, 2682, 3195, 2171, 127, 640, 2176, 131, 4235, 3724, 1678, 2191, 144, 2703, 3727, 1683, 1177, 154, 2713, 4768, 2721, 2213, 3752, 1193, 3243, 3244, 174, 1711, 3759, 4785, 3252, 182, 2743, 698, 4286, 4799, 3777, 2760, 1739, 2764, 717, 3277, 3795, 4307, 213, 3799, 4824, 4313, 3803, 3804, 3805, 734, 4829, 3808, 3812, 3813, 3303, 748, 2798, 239, 1780, 757, 1783, 2297, 762, 1275, 3322, 4859, 3842, 1795, 1291, 1292, 1803, 782, 1295, 1808, 2322, 3348, 3862, 795, 3869, 4895, 290, 3874, 3365, 294, 1319, 4905, 810, 1323, 812, 303, 4400, 2355, 4916, 1334, 311, 1847, 4407, 826, 2875, 4924, 4413, 3903, 2368, 327, 4426, 2891, 4941, 4430, 4942, 4944, 1873, 3413, 2391, 3927, 2908, 4445, 1374, 1888, 3936, 1890, 870, 873, 3434, 4971, 1388, 3436, 1907, 889, 890, 3451, 892, 4990, 3970, 387, 2435, 3459, 3460, 1418, 2955, 3979, 5003, 4496, 401, 1938, 1432, 3481, 3482, 3483, 3994, 3489, 4007, 1960, 2984, 5033, 5037, 4014, 4526, 2483, 4020, 1979, 5052, 3519, 3520, 1475, 5060, 452, 964, 1477, 1990, 3524, 4549, 5059, 971, 2507, 1997, 1486, 2508, 5065, 467, 5077, 982, 3542, 3544, 5079, 3034, 2525, 1502, 3040, 5097, 492, 1008, 5106, 5107, 2039, 2040, 4605}",258,"['Fidel Castro', 'Cuba', 'Osvaldo', 'Fidel Alejandro', 'American', 'Spanish', 'August 1926', 'November 2016', 'Cuban', 'Marxist', 'Leninist', 'Cuban', 'Castro', 'the Republic of Cuba', 'the Communist Party', 'Cuba', '1961', '2011', '1959', '1976', 'the Council of State and Council of Ministers', '1976 to 2008', 'Castro', 'the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces', 'Cuba', 'communist', 'Birán', 'Oriente', 'Spanish', 'Castro', 'the University of Havana', 'the Dominican Republic and Colombia', 'Cuban', 'Fulgencio Batista', 'the Moncada Barracks', '1953', 'year', 'Castro', 'Mexico', 'Raúl Castro', 'Ernesto', 'Che"" Guevara', 'Cuba', 'Castro', 'the Cuban Revolution', 'Batista', 'the Sierra Maestra', 'Batista', '1959', 'Castro', 'Cuba', 'The United States', 'Castro', 'the Bay of Pigs Invasion', '1961', 'Castro', 'the Soviet Union', 'Soviets', 'Cuba', 'Cuban', 'the Cold War', '1962', 'Marxist', 'Castro', 'Cuba', 'Communist Party', 'the Western Hemisphere', 'Castro', 'Marxist', 'Chile', 'Nicaragua', 'Grenada', 'the Yom Kippur', 'Ogaden', 'Angolan Civil War', 'Castro', 'the Non-Aligned Movement', '1979 to 1983', 'Cuba', 'Cuba', ""the Soviet Union's"", '1991', 'Castro', 'Cuba', 'the 2000s', 'Castro', 'Latin American', ""Hugo Chávez's"", 'Venezuela', 'Cuba', 'the Bolivarian Alliance', 'Americas', '2006', 'Castro', 'Raúl Castro', 'the National Assembly', '2008', 'the 20th and 21st centuries', 'Castro', 'Cuba', 'US', 'Cubans', 'Castro']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON']"

268,1976,July,12,"1st ""Family Feud"" game show debuts on ABC hosted by Richard Dawson",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Feud,"Family Feud is an American television game show created by Mark Goodson where two families compete to name the most popular responses to survey questions in order to win cash and prizes. It first aired on July 12, 1976, on ABC, and has also aired on CBS and in syndication.
The show has had three separate runs; the original run from 1976–1985 aired on ABC during the daytime, and had a separate nighttime edition that ran in syndication and was also hosted by Richard Dawson.  In 1988, the series was revived and aired on CBS and also had a nighttime syndication edition. This version was hosted by Ray Combs until 1994, and brought back Richard Dawson for the 1994–1995 season. A third run began in 1999 in syndication only, and continues to run to this day, being hosted by a series of different hosts, including Louie Anderson (1999–2002), Richard Karn (2002–2006), John O'Hurley (2006–2010), and Steve Harvey (2010–present). Aside from the hosts, there have been several studio announcers who would introduce the contestants and read credits.  These have included Gene Wood (1976–1985, 1988–1995), Burton Richardson (1999–2010, 2015–present Celebrity Family Feud only), Joey Fatone (2010–2015), and Rubin Ervin (2015–present). Within a year of its debut, the original version became the number one game show in daytime television; however, as viewing habits changed, the ratings declined. Harvey's takeover in 2010 increased Nielsen ratings significantly and eventually placed the program among the top five most popular syndicated television shows in the country. Harvey has also surpassed every previous host to date in length of single consecutive tenures, although Dawson hosted more episodes of the show. In 2013, TV Guide ranked Family Feud third in its list of the 60 greatest game shows of all time.
The program has spawned multiple regional adaptations in over 50 international markets outside the United States. Reruns of Steve Harvey-hosted episodes air on Game Show Network, while reruns of earlier versions air on Buzzr. Aside from TV shows, there have been also many home editions produced in board game, interactive film, and video game formats.",set(),0,"['Family Feud', 'ABC', 'Richard Dawson', 'Family Feud', 'American', 'Mark Goodson', 'July 12, 1976', 'ABC', 'CBS', 'ABC', 'Richard Dawson', '1988', 'CBS', 'Ray Combs', '1994', 'Richard Dawson', 'the 1994–1995 season', '1999', 'this day', 'Louie Anderson', 'Richard Karn', ""John O'Hurley"", 'Steve Harvey', 'Gene Wood', 'Burton Richardson', 'Celebrity Family Feud', 'Joey Fatone', 'Rubin Ervin', 'a year', 'Harvey', '2010', 'Nielsen', 'Harvey', 'Dawson', '2013', 'Family Feud', 'the United States', 'Steve Harvey', 'Game Show Network', 'Buzzr']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'GPE']"

270,1976,November,21,"""Rocky"" directed by John G. Avildsen and starring Sylvester Stallone premieres in New York (Best Picture 1977)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky,"Rocky is a 1976 American sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen, written by and starring Sylvester Stallone. It tells the rags to riches American Dream story of Rocky Balboa, an uneducated, kind-hearted working class Italian-American boxer, working as a debt collector for a loan shark in the slums of Philadelphia.  Rocky, a small-time club fighter, gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship. The film also stars Talia Shire as Adrian, Burt Young as Adrian's brother Paulie, Burgess Meredith as Rocky's trainer Mickey Goldmill, and Carl Weathers as the reigning champion, Apollo Creed.
The film, made on a budget of just over $1 million, was a sleeper hit; it earned $225 million in global box office receipts, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1976. The film was critically acclaimed and solidified Stallone's career as well as commenced his rise to prominence as a major movie star. Among other accolades, it went on to receive ten Academy Award nominations, winning three, including Best Picture. In 2006, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"". Rocky is considered to be one of the greatest sports films ever made and was ranked as the second-best in the genre, after Raging Bull, by the American Film Institute in 2008.
The film has spawned seven sequels: Rocky II (1979), Rocky III (1982), Rocky IV (1985), Rocky V (1990), Rocky Balboa (2006), Creed (2015), and Creed II (2018). Stallone portrays Rocky in all eight films, wrote seven of the eight films, and directed four of the six titular installments. In July 2019, Stallone said in an interview that there have been ongoing discussions about a prequel to the original film based on the life of a young Rocky Balboa.","{1272, 3459, 1795, 3332, 2568, 2955, 3979, 1168, 3091, 2964, 1307, 4642, 1576, 1706, 3371, 3882, 2171, 1711, 4400, 948, 694, 1464, 1979, 4923, 703, 4671, 4675, 1997, 4558, 4688, 4307, 2388, 4437, 1502, 3427, 2152, 4330, 4971, 748, 1006, 4472, 3578, 1275, 4605, 4990}",45,"['Rocky', 'John G.

Barry Manilow's version reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in January 1976 after spending two weeks atop the Billboard adult contemporary chart in December 1975. It won a Grammy Award for Song of the Year and was nominated for Record of the Year in 1977. Billboard ranked it as the No. 13 song of 1976.The original version was recorded by the Captain & Tennille, who worked with Johnston in the early 1970s with the Beach Boys. It appears on their 1975 album Love Will Keep Us Together. The first release of ""I Write the Songs"" as a single was by teen idol David Cassidy from his 1975 solo album The Higher They Climb, which was also produced by Johnston. Cassidy's version reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart in August of that year.Johnston has stated that, for him, the ""I"" in the song is God, and that songs come from the spirit of creativity in everyone. He has said that the song is not about his Beach Boys bandmate Brian Wilson.Manilow was initially reluctant to record the song, stating in his autobiography Sweet Life: ""The problem with the song was that if you didn't listen carefully to the lyric, you would think that the singer was singing about himself. It could be misinterpreted as a monumental ego trip."" After persuasion by Clive Davis, then president of Arista Records, Manilow recorded the song, and his version of ""I Write the Songs"" was the first single taken from the album Tryin' to Get the Feeling.

It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 album A Night at the Opera. It is a six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda. The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre.""Bohemian Rhapsody"" topped the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks and had sold more than a million copies by the end of January 1976. In 1991, after Mercury's death, it topped the charts for another five weeks, eventually becoming the UK's third-bestselling single of all time. It is also the only song to reach the UK Christmas number one twice by the same artist. It also topped the charts in countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the Netherlands, becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time selling over six million copies worldwide. In the United States, the song peaked at number nine in 1976, but reached a new peak of number two on the Billboard Hot 100 after being used in the film Wayne's World (1992). In 2018, the release of Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody brought the song renewed popularity and chart success worldwide.
Although critical reaction was initially mixed, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" became Queen's most popular song and is considered one of the greatest rock songs of all time. The single was accompanied by a groundbreaking promotional video. Rolling Stone stated that its influence ""cannot be overstated, practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air."" The Guardian named its music video one of the 50 key events in rock music history, helping make videos a critical tool in music marketing.In 2004, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

The company also has a chain of retail stores known as Apple Stores. Apple's core product lines are the iPhone smartphone, iPad tablet computer, iPod portable media players, and Macintosh computer line. Founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created Apple Computer on April 1, 1976, and incorporated the company on January 3, 1977, in Cupertino, California.
For more than three decades, Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and Power Mac lines, but it faced rocky sales and low market share during the 1990s. Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1996 after his company NeXT was bought by Apple. The following year he became the company's interim CEO, which later became permanent. Jobs subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of recognizable products and simple design, starting with the original iMac in 1998.
With the introduction of the successful iPod music player in 2001 and iTunes Music Store in 2003, Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries, leading it to drop ""Computer"" from the company's name in 2007. The company is now also known for its iOS range of smart phone, media player, and tablet computer products that began with the iPhone, followed by the iPod Touch and then iPad. As of 30 June 2015, Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization, with an estimated value of US$1 trillion as of August 2, 2018.

Although British culture is a distinct entity, the individual cultures of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are diverse and have varying degrees of overlap and distinctiveness.British literature is particularly esteemed. The novel was invented in Britain (see however, Genji monogatari), and playwrights, poets, and authors are among its most prominent cultural figures. Britain has also made notable contributions to music, cinema, art, architecture and television. The UK is also the home of the Church of England, the state church and mother church of the Anglican Communion, the third-largest Christian denomination. Britain contains some of the world's oldest universities, has made many contributions to philosophy, science and technology, and is the birthplace of many prominent scientists and inventions. The Industrial Revolution began in the UK and had a profound effect on the family socio-economic and cultural conditions of the world. As a result of the British Empire significant British influence can be observed in the language, law, culture and institutions of its former colonies, most of which are members of the Commonwealth of Nations. A subset of these states form the Anglosphere, and are among Britain's closest allies. British colonies and dominions influenced British culture in turn, particularly British cuisine. Sport is an important part of British culture, and numerous sports originated in the country including football.
The UK has been described as a ""cultural superpower"", and London has been described as a world cultural capital.

Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS App Store, Mac App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iMessage, and iCloud. Other services include Apple Store, Genius Bar, AppleCare, Apple Pay, Apple Pay Cash, and Apple Card.
Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer, though Wayne sold his share back within 12 days. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc., in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee, while Jobs and others resigned to found NeXT.As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of Microsoft Windows on Intel PC clones. The board recruited CEO Gil Amelio to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially troubled company—reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. In 1997, he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back. Jobs pensively regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing Think different campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching the iMac in 1998, opening the retail chain of Apple Stores in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the iPhone to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and Tim Cook became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, Jony Ive, Apple's CDO, left the company to start his own firm but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client.
Apple is well known for its size and revenues. Its worldwide annual revenue totaled $265 billion for the 2018 fiscal year. Apple is the world's largest technology company by revenue and one of the world's most valuable companies. It is also the world's third-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung and Huawei. In August 2018, Apple became the first public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion.

It stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew. It is the first installment of the original Star Wars trilogy, the first of the franchise to be produced, and the fourth episode of the ""Skywalker saga"".
Lucas had the idea for a science-fiction film in the vein of Flash Gordon around the time he completed his first film, THX 1138 (1971), and began working on a treatment after the release of American Graffiti (1973). Star Wars focuses on the journey of Luke Skywalker (Hamill), who along with Han Solo (Ford) and the wizened Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Guinness), attempt to free Rebellion leader Princess Leia (Fisher) from the clutches of the Galactic Empire and the Sith lord Darth Vader (Prowse, voiced by Jones). The heroes, in league with the Rebel Alliance, attempt to destroy the Empire's planet-destroying space station, the Death Star.
Star Wars was released in a limited number of theaters in the United States on May 25, 1977, and quickly became a blockbuster hit, leading to it being expanded to a much wider release. The film opened to critical acclaim, most notably for its groundbreaking visual effects. It grossed a total of $775 million, surpassing Jaws (1975) to become the highest-grossing film at the time until the release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). When adjusted for inflation, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film in North America (behind Gone with the Wind) and the fourth-highest-grossing film in the world. It received ten Oscar nominations (including Best Picture), winning seven. In 1989, it became one of the first films to be selected as part of the U.S. Library of Congress's National Film Registry as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."" At the time, it was the most recent film in the registry and the only one chosen from the 1970s. In 2004, its soundtrack was added to the U.S. National Recording Registry. Today, it is regarded as one of the most important films in the history of motion pictures.
The film has been reissued multiple times with Lucas's support—most significantly with its 20th-anniversary theatrical ""Special Edition""—incorporating many changes including modified computer-generated effects, altered dialogue, re-edited shots, remixed soundtracks and added scenes. The film became a ""pop-cultural phenomenon"" and launched an industry of tie-in products, including novels, comics, video games, amusement park attractions, and merchandise including toys, games, clothing and many other spin-off works.
The film's success led to two critically and commercially successful sequels, The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), and later to a prequel trilogy, a sequel trilogy, two anthology films and various spin-off TV series.","{4611, 2052, 6, 1031, 7, 2568, 2579, 2069, 1559, 1562, 4123, 1563, 1566, 4643, 550, 4134, 1576, 3625, 1066, 46, 1583, 561, 563, 4154, 70, 1095, 2122, 4682, 1616, 595, 2649, 3167, 1633, 3682, 3171, 4199, 1133, 629, 2171, 640, 1153, 652, 2703, 3727, 1178, 1183, 4255, 2721, 2210, 4768, 680, 3243, 3758, 1711, 4785, 188, 4287, 4800, 1217, 3777, 2245, 1740, 3795, 4307, 3803, 4829, 2274, 1251, 3299, 1765, 3811, 2793, 748, 4845, 1272, 3833, 3322, 3834, 3842, 1795, 1288, 1804, 269, 273, 1299, 4890, 1822, 287, 4895, 290, 803, 3365, 1830, 1319, 4905, 3371, 4400, 2865, 310, 1847, 826, 2875, 830, 2878, 1346, 1865, 2891, 2896, 851, 2901, 3413, 1372, 861, 2916, 4971, 3437, 2415, 3954, 889, 4474, 4990, 895, 4480, 3457, 386, 3459, 3970, 1925, 1414, 4487, 4994, 2955, 5003, 1938, 1432, 3483, 5019, 3489, 418, 4516, 423, 936, 3497, 4007, 5033, 1466, 1979, 4539, 5052, 452, 4549, 1990, 971, 2507, 2509, 467, 5077, 471, 1502, 2529, 2018, 1508, 998, 3049, 2026, 1526, 504, 4601, 4605}",169,"['Star Wars', 'George Lucas', 'Mark Hamill', 'Carrie Fisher', 'Harrison Ford', 'Star Wars: Episode IV', '1977', 'American', 'George Lucas', '20th Century-Fox', 'Mark Hamill', 'Harrison Ford', 'Carrie Fisher', 'Peter Cushing', 'Alec Guinness', 'David Prowse', 'James Earl Jones', 'Anthony Daniels', 'Kenny Baker', 'Peter Mayhew', 'Star Wars', 'Skywalker', 'Lucas', 'Flash Gordon', '1971', 'American Graffiti', '1973', 'Luke Skywalker', 'Han', 'Ford', 'Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi', 'Guinness', 'Princess Leia', 'the Galactic Empire', 'Sith', 'Darth Vader', 'Jones', 'the Rebel Alliance', 'Empire', 'the Death Star', 'Star Wars', 'the United States', 'May 25, 1977', '1975', 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial', '1982', 'Star Wars', 'North America', 'Oscar', '1989', 'U.S.', 'Congress', 'National Film Registry', 'the 1970s', '2004', 'the U.S. National Recording Registry', 'Today', 'Lucas', '20th-anniversary', 'The Empire Strikes Back', '1980', 'Return of the Jedi', '1983', 'prequel']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'NORP']"

They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians. Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, they are regarded as one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music.The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten (John Lydon), guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock. Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977. Under the management of Malcolm McLaren, the band attracted controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain. Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single ""God Save the Queen"", attacking Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, they precipitated the punk rock movement.
In January 1978, at the end of an over-hyped and turbulent tour of the United States, Rotten announced the band's break-up. Over the next few months, the three remaining band members recorded songs for McLaren's film version of the Sex Pistols' story, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979, following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend.
Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock briefly reunited for a concert tour in 1996. On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistols—the four original members plus Vicious—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but they refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum ""a piss stain"".","{640, 4993, 3842, 3459, 3970, 7, 4235, 2703, 1168, 3727, 1170, 1555, 4879, 3989, 1275, 1566, 4895, 4768, 290, 1699, 2210, 3365, 4134, 4642, 1576, 4905, 46, 1454, 310, 4024, 1465, 4536, 2875, 4539, 4413, 452, 4549, 967, 1095, 2122, 971, 4940, 1483, 2379, 4815, 2507, 2891, 336, 4682, 3154, 595, 3451, 3795, 1622, 3927, 4307, 5077, 889, 607, 3046, 2152, 2153, 4971, 3180, 4589, 1649, 1780, 3322, 2169, 4474, 2171, 4605}",72,"['Sex Pistols', 'BBC', 'The Sex Pistols', 'English', 'London', '1975', 'the United Kingdom', 'Never Mind the Bollocks', 'the Sex Pistols', 'The Sex Pistols', 'Johnny Rotten', 'John Lydon', 'Steve Jones', 'Paul Cook', 'Glen Matlock', 'Matlock', 'Sid Vicious', 'early 1977', 'Malcolm McLaren', 'Britain', 'December 1976', 'May 1977', 'Britons', 'Crown', 'January 1978', 'the United States', 'the next few months', 'McLaren', ""The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle"", 'February 1979', 'Jones', 'Cook', 'Matlock', '1996', '24 February 2006', 'the Sex Pistols', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame']","['ORG', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'LANGUAGE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG']"
296,1977,February,4,"""Rumours"" 11th studio album by Fleetwood Mac is released (Grammy Album of the Year)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumours_(album),"Rumours is the eleventh studio album by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on 4 February 1977 by Warner Bros. Records. Largely recorded in California in 1976, it was produced by the band with Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. The band wanted to expand on the commercial success of their eponymous 1975 album, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonism and strife among band members that shaped the album's lyrics.
Recorded with the intention of making ""a pop album"", the album's music featured a pop rock and soft rock sound characterized by accented rhythms and electric keyboards such as the Fender Rhodes or Hammond B3 organ. The members partied and used cocaine for much of the recording sessions, and its completion was delayed by its mixing process, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours. Rumours reached the top of both the US Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart, and became the band's most successful release. The songs ""Go Your Own Way"", ""Dreams"", ""Don't Stop"", and ""You Make Loving Fun"" were released as singles, all of which reached the US top 10. 
Rumours garnered widespread acclaim from critics, with praise centred on its production quality and harmonies, which frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists and has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres. It won Album of the Year at the 20th Grammy Awards. It has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It has received Diamond certifications in several countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, and Australia. 
Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, the album has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and of all time. In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued with the addition of ""Silver Springs"", which had been excluded from the original due to tension within the band, and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions. In 2003, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2006, Time named it in its All-TIME 100 Albums list. In 2018, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry, being deemed ""culturally, historically, or artistically significant"" by the Library of Congress.","{1378, 4741}",2,"['Rumours', 'Fleetwood Mac', 'Grammy Album of the Year', 'Rumours', 'British-American', 'Fleetwood Mac', '4 February 1977', 'Warner Bros.

307,1978,January,23,"Sweden becomes the first nation in the world to ban aerosol sprays, believed to be damaging to earth's ozone layer.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion,"Ozone depletion consists of two related events observed since the late 1970s: a steady lowering of about four percent in the total amount of ozone in Earth's atmosphere (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone around Earth's polar regions. The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole. There are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events in addition to these stratospheric events.
In 2019, NASA announced that the ""ozone hole"" over Antarctica was the smallest ever since it was first discovered in 1982.The main cause of ozone depletion and the ozone hole is manufactured chemicals, especially manufactured halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCFCs, halons), referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by turbulent mixing after being emitted from the surface, mixing much faster than the molecules can settle. Once in the stratosphere, they release halogen atoms through photodissociation, which catalyze the breakdown of ozone (O3) into oxygen (O2). Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of halocarbons increased
Ozone depletion and the ozone hole have generated worldwide concern over increased cancer risks and other negative effects. The ozone layer prevents most harmful UV wavelengths of ultraviolet light (UV light) from passing through the Earth's atmosphere. These wavelengths cause skin cancer, sunburn, permanent blindness and cataracts, which were projected to increase dramatically as a result of thinning ozone, as well as harming plants and animals. These concerns led to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, which bans the production of CFCs, halons and other ozone-depleting chemicals.
The ban came into effect in 1989. Ozone levels stabilized by the mid-1990s and began to recover in the 2000s, as the shifting of the jet stream in the southern hemisphere towards the south pole has stopped and might even be reversing. Recovery is projected to continue over the next century, and the ozone hole is expected to reach pre-1980 levels by around 2075. The Montreal Protocol is considered the most successful international environmental agreement to date.","{1668, 1802, 2955, 3989, 3864, 5019, 1821, 33, 290, 2210, 4134, 4402, 4024, 442, 1343, 967, 3528, 2507, 4815, 3154, 4307, 2388, 2261, 2645, 5074, 603, 3036, 743, 4971, 4589, 2169, 2171, 893, 2558, 3199}",35,"['Sweden', 'earth', 'the late 1970s', 'about four percent', 'Earth', 'Earth', '2019', 'NASA', 'Antarctica', 'Earth', 'the Montreal Protocol', '1987', '1989', 'the mid-1990s', 'the 2000s', 'the south pole', 'the next century', 'pre-1980', 'around 2075', 'The Montreal Protocol']","['GPE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LAW']"
308,1978,September,16,"25,000 die in 7.7 earthquake in Tabar, Iran",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_War,"The Lebanese Civil War (Arabic: الحرب الأهلية اللبنانية‎ – Al-Ḥarb al-Ahliyyah al-Libnāniyyah) was a multifaceted civil war in Lebanon, lasting from 1975 to 1990 and resulting in an estimated 120,000 fatalities. As of 2012, approximately 76,000 people remain displaced within Lebanon. There was also an exodus of almost one million people from Lebanon as a result of the war.Before the war, Lebanon was multisectarian, with Sunni Muslims and Christians being the majorities in the coastal cities, Shia Muslims being mainly based in the south and the Beqaa Valley to the east, and with the mountain populations being mostly Druze and Christian. The government of Lebanon had been run under a significant influence of the elites among the Maronite Christians. The link between politics and religion had been reinforced under the mandate of the French colonial powers from 1920 to 1943, and the parliamentary structure favored a leading position for its Christian population. However, the country had a large Muslim population and many pan-Arabist and left-wing groups opposed the pro-western government. The establishment of the state of Israel and the displacement of a hundred thousand Palestinian refugees to Lebanon during the 1948 and 1967 exoduses contributed to shifting the demographic balance in favor of the Muslim population. The Cold War had a powerful disintegrative effect on Lebanon, which was closely linked to the polarization that preceded the 1958 political crisis, since Maronites sided with the West while leftist and pan-Arab groups sided with Soviet-aligned Arab countries.Fighting between Maronite and Palestinian forces (mainly from the Palestine Liberation Organization) began in 1975, then Leftist, pan-Arabist and Muslim Lebanese groups formed an alliance with the Palestinians. During the course of the fighting, alliances shifted rapidly and unpredictably. Furthermore, foreign powers, such as Israel and Syria, became involved in the war and fought alongside different factions. Peacekeeping forces, such as the Multinational Force in Lebanon and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, were also stationed in Lebanon.
The 1989 Taif Agreement marked the beginning of the end of the fighting. In January 1989, a committee appointed by the Arab League began to formulate solutions to the conflict. In March 1991, parliament passed an amnesty law that pardoned all political crimes prior to its enactment.

309,1978,September,17,"Anwar Sadat, Menachem Begin and Jimmy Carter sign the Camp David Accords, frameworks for peace in the Middle East and between Egypt and Israel",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David_Accords,"The Camp David Accords were a pair of political agreements signed by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin on 17 September 1978, following twelve days of secret negotiations at Camp David, the country retreat of the President of the United States in Maryland. The two framework agreements were signed at the White House and were witnessed by President Jimmy Carter. The second of these frameworks (A Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel) led directly to the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. Due to the agreement, Sadat and Begin received the shared 1978 Nobel Peace Prize. The first framework (A Framework for Peace in the Middle East), which dealt with the Palestinian territories, was written without participation of the Palestinians and was condemned by the United Nations.
Historian Jørgen Jensehaugen argues that by the time Carter left office in January 1981, he:

was in an odd position—he had attempted to break with traditional US policy but ended up fulfilling the goals of that tradition, which had been to break up the Arab alliance, side-line the Palestinians, build an alliance with Egypt, weaken the Soviet Union and secure Israel.","{4101, 7, 2568, 521, 524, 528, 4113, 3090, 1557, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1566, 1058, 3110, 39, 1576, 2601, 4134, 4138, 4647, 3630, 1583, 2096, 2104, 1081, 3139, 2628, 4682, 4688, 3154, 595, 1622, 2647, 2649, 2652, 3676, 606, 4192, 1633, 2152, 2155, 3693, 1136, 1649, 3190, 3702, 2169, 2682, 3195, 2170, 2171, 2684, 3199, 128, 640, 1153, 131, 2176, 4736, 1162, 3722, 2703, 144, 656, 3727, 4768, 2210, 2213, 680, 1192, 173, 174, 4785, 3252, 699, 703, 4287, 2241, 1730, 3777, 1732, 3272, 2764, 717, 3277, 2767, 3795, 4307, 4313, 3804, 1757, 3805, 4829, 3808, 1251, 2278, 3303, 2793, 234, 2794, 4330, 2798, 1783, 2297, 3322, 1275, 3842, 771, 1288, 1292, 1808, 3869, 4895, 290, 3874, 294, 4905, 4916, 309, 311, 2875, 1341, 3903, 1857, 4941, 4942, 2388, 2901, 2391, 1888, 355, 1386, 4971, 2415, 3951, 4472, 889, 890, 3451, 4474, 4990, 4993, 3970, 3459, 3460, 4994, 903, 2955, 3979, 1424, 401, 3989, 1432, 418, 4516, 4014, 4020, 1979, 4539, 961, 5059, 452, 453, 964, 4549, 5065, 971, 2507, 1997, 2508, 5067, 5077, 5079, 3544, 3034, 2525, 990, 1502, 3040, 2529, 1508, 2026, 492, 4589, 5106, 5107, 1526, 2040, 3578, 4605}",191,"['Anwar Sadat', 'Menachem Begin', 'Jimmy Carter', 'the Camp David Accords', 'the Middle East', 'Egypt', 'Israel', 'Egyptian', 'Anwar Sadat', 'Israeli', 'Menachem Begin', '17 September 1978', 'twelve days', 'Camp David', 'the United States', 'Maryland', 'the White House', 'Jimmy Carter', 'Egypt', 'Israel', '1979', 'Egypt', 'Israel Peace Treaty', 'Sadat', '1978', 'Nobel Peace Prize', 'the Middle East', 'Palestinian', 'Palestinians', 'the United Nations', 'Historian', 'Jørgen Jensehaugen', 'Carter', 'January 1981', 'US', 'Arab', 'Palestinians', 'Egypt', 'the Soviet Union', 'Israel']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE']"

311,1978,October,16,Polish Cardinal Karol Wojtyla elected Pope John Paul II,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II,"Pope John Paul II (Latin: Ioannes Paulus II; Italian: Giovanni Paolo II; Polish: Jan Paweł II; born Karol Józef Wojtyła [ˈkarɔl ˈjuzɛv vɔjˈtɨwa]; 18 May 1920 – 2 April 2005) was head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State from 1978 to 2005. 
He was elected pope by the second papal conclave of 1978, which was called after Pope John Paul I, who had been elected in August to succeed Pope Paul VI, died after 33 days. Cardinal Wojtyła was elected on the third day of the conclave and adopted the name of his predecessor in tribute to him. John Paul II is recognised as helping to end Communist rule in his native Poland and eventually all of Europe. John Paul II significantly improved the Catholic Church's relations with Judaism, Islam, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. He upheld the Church's teachings on such matters as the right to life, artificial contraception, the ordination of women, and a celibate clergy, and although he supported the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, he was seen as generally conservative in their interpretation.He was one of the most travelled world leaders in history, visiting 129 countries during his pontificate. As part of his special emphasis on the universal call to holiness, he beatified 1,340 and canonised 483 people, more than the combined tally of his predecessors during the preceding five centuries. By the time of his death, he had named most of the College of Cardinals, consecrated or co-consecrated a large number of the world's bishops, and ordained many priests.John Paul II was the second longest-serving pope in modern history after Pope Pius IX. Born in Poland, John Paul II was the first non-Italian pope since the 16th-century Pope Adrian VI. John Paul II's cause for canonisation commenced one month after his death with the traditional five-year waiting period waived. On 19 December 2009, John Paul II was proclaimed venerable by his successor, Benedict XVI, and was beatified on 1 May 2011 (Divine Mercy Sunday) after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints attributed one miracle to his intercession, the healing of a French nun from Parkinson's disease. A second miracle was approved on 2 July 2013, and confirmed by Pope Francis two days later. John Paul II was canonised on 27 April 2014 (again Divine Mercy Sunday), together with Pope John XXIII. On 11 September 2014, Pope Francis added these two optional memorials to the worldwide General Roman Calendar of saints. It is traditional to celebrate saints' feast days on the anniversary of their deaths, but that of John Paul II (22 October) is celebrated on the anniversary of his papal inauguration. Posthumously, he has been referred to by some Catholics as ""St. John Paul the Great"", although the title has no official recognition.","{2051, 7, 524, 1036, 28, 2590, 4134, 1576, 1583, 4671, 1092, 4682, 595, 1622, 2141, 3693, 1649, 3185, 3702, 2169, 2171, 128, 640, 1153, 4736, 1162, 2703, 1168, 3727, 4756, 1177, 4768, 2210, 4770, 4775, 174, 1204, 3252, 3272, 208, 4307, 4825, 1757, 1251, 2278, 2793, 234, 3322, 1275, 3842, 271, 273, 4895, 290, 3874, 2342, 1323, 2861, 4924, 3903, 847, 2388, 2901, 3427, 355, 1388, 2415, 3951, 1908, 889, 4986, 3451, 4993, 3970, 4994, 900, 903, 2955, 3979, 1424, 3989, 418, 2483, 4020, 4024, 4536, 4539, 452, 3524, 4549, 5060, 971, 1483, 2507, 5077, 2529, 1508, 997, 3046, 2026, 4589, 494, 1526, 2040, 4605}",105,"['Polish', 'Karol Wojtyla', 'John Paul II', 'John Paul II', 'Latin', 'Italian', 'Giovanni Paolo II', 'Polish', 'Jan Paweł II', 'Karol Józef Wojtyła', 'May 1920', '2 April 2005', 'the Catholic Church', 'the Vatican City State', '1978 to 2005', '1978', 'John Paul', 'August', 'Paul VI', '33 days', 'Cardinal Wojtyła', 'the third day', 'John Paul II', 'Communist', 'Poland', 'Europe', 'John Paul II', ""the Catholic Church's"", 'Islam', 'the Eastern Orthodox Church', 'Church', 'the Second Vatican Council', 'the preceding five centuries', 'the College of Cardinals', 'John Paul II', 'Pope Pius IX', 'Poland', 'John Paul II', 'non-Italian', 'the 16th-century', ""John Paul II's"", 'one month', 'five-year', '19 December 2009', 'John Paul II', 'Benedict XVI', '1 May 2011', 'Sunday', 'Saints', 'French', '2 July 2013', 'Pope Francis', 'two days later', 'John Paul II', '27 April 2014', 'Divine Mercy', 'Sunday', 'John XXIII', '11 September 2014', 'Pope Francis', 'Roman Calendar', 'John Paul II', '22 October', 'Catholics']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP']"
312,1978,November,6,Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi places the country under military rule; General Gholām Reza Azhāri forms government,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi,"Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (Persian: محمد رضا پهلوی‎, pronounced [mohæmˈmæd reˈzɒː ˈʃɒːh pæhlæˈviː]; 26 October 1919 – 27 July 1980), also known as Mohammad Reza Shah (محمد رضا شاه), was the last Shah (Emperor) of Iran from 16 September 1941 until his overthrow in the Iranian Revolution on 11 February 1979. Due to his status as the last Shah of Iran, he is often known as simply the Shah.
Mohammad Reza Shah took the title Shahanshah (""King of Kings"") on 26 October 1967. He was the second and last monarch of the House of Pahlavi. Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi held several other titles, including that of Aryamehr (""Light of the Aryans"") and Bozorg Arteshtaran (""Commander-in-Chief""). His dream of what he referred to as a ""Great Civilisation"" (Persian: تمدن بزرگ‎, romanized: tamadon-e bozorg) in Iran led to a rapid industrial and military modernisation, as well as economic and social reforms.Mohammad Reza came to power during World War II after an Anglo-Soviet invasion forced the abdication of his father, Reza Shah Pahlavi. During Mohammad Reza's reign, the British owned oil industry was briefly nationalized by Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh until a UK- and US-backed coup d'état deposed Mosaddegh and brought back foreign oil firms under the Consortium Agreement of 1954.During Mohammad Reza's reign, Iran marked the anniversary of 2,500 years of continuous Persian monarchy since the founding of the Achaemenid Empire by Cyrus the Great.  Concurrent with this celebration, Mohammad Reza changed the benchmark of the Iranian calendar from the hegira to the beginning of the First Persian Empire, measured from Cyrus the Great's coronation. Mohammad Reza also introduced the White Revolution, a series of economic, social and political reforms with the proclaimed intention of transforming Iran into a global power and modernizing the nation by nationalizing certain industries and granting women suffrage. During his 38-year rule, Iran spent billions on industry, education, health, and armed forces and enjoyed economic growth rates exceeding the United States, England, and France.  The national income also rose 423 times over.  By 1977, Iran's armed services spending had made it the world's fifth strongest military. Mohammad Reza lost support from the Shi'a clergy of Iran and the working class due to alleged corruption related to himself and the royal family, suppression of political dissent via Iran's intelligence agency, SAVAK (including the arrest of up to 3,200 political prisoners), banishment of the Tudeh Party, US and UK support for his regime, his modernization policies, more rights for women, laïcité or secularism, conflict with wealthy merchants known as bazaaris, relations with Israel, and clashes with leftists and Islamists.
By 1979, this political unrest became a revolution leading to the monarchy's overthrow. The Shah's refusal to order his troops to fire on protesters forced him to leave Iran on 17 January 1979. Soon thereafter, the Iranian monarchy was formally abolished, and Iran was declared an Islamic republic led by Ruhollah Khomeini (known in the West as Ayatollah Khomeini). Facing likely execution should he return to Iran, the Shah died in exile in Egypt, whose president, Anwar Sadat, had granted him asylum.","{2273, 1378, 4741}",3,"['Iran', 'Reza Azhāri', 'Mohammad Reza Pahlavi', 'Persian', 'محمد رضا پهلوی\u200e', 'October 1919', '27 July 1980', 'Mohammad Reza Shah', 'محمد رضا شاه', 'Iran', '16 September 1941', 'the Iranian Revolution', '11 February 1979', 'Iran', 'Shah', 'Mohammad Reza Shah', 'King of Kings', '26 October 1967', 'the House of Pahlavi', 'Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi', 'Aryamehr', '""Light of the Aryans""', 'Bozorg Arteshtaran', 'Persian', 'Iran', 'Mohammad Reza', 'World War II', 'Anglo', 'Reza Shah Pahlavi', ""Mohammad Reza's"", 'British', 'Iranian', 'Mohammad Mosaddegh', 'US', 'Mosaddegh', 'the Consortium Agreement', ""Mohammad Reza's"", 'Iran', '2,500 years', 'Persian', 'the Achaemenid Empire', 'Cyrus the Great', 'Mohammad Reza', 'Iranian', 'the First Persian Empire', ""Cyrus the Great's"", 'Mohammad Reza', 'the White Revolution', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'the United States', 'England', 'France', '1977', 'Iran', 'Mohammad Reza', ""Shi'a"", 'Iran', 'Iran', 'SAVAK', 'the Tudeh Party', 'US', 'UK', 'bazaaris', 'Israel', 'Islamists', '1979', 'Iran', '17 January 1979', 'Iranian', 'Iran', 'Islamic', 'Ruhollah Khomeini', 'West', 'Ayatollah Khomeini', 'Iran', 'Shah', 'Egypt', 'Anwar Sadat']","['GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'LAW', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON']"

It became internationally known when, on November 18, 1978, a total of 918 people died at the settlement, at the nearby airstrip in Port Kaituma, and at a Temple-run building in Georgetown, Guyana's capital city. The name of the settlement became synonymous with the incidents at those locations.In total, 909 individuals died in Jonestown, all but two from apparent cyanide poisoning, in an event termed ""revolutionary suicide"" by Jones and some Peoples Temple members on an audio tape of the event, and in prior recorded discussions. The poisonings in Jonestown followed the murder of five others by Temple members at Port Kaituma, including United States Congressman Leo Ryan, an act that Jones ordered. Four other Temple members committed murder-suicide in Georgetown at Jones' command.
Terms used to describe the deaths in Jonestown and Georgetown evolved over time. Many contemporary media accounts after the events called the deaths a mass suicide. In contrast, most sources today refer to the deaths with terms such as mass murder-suicide, a massacre, or simply mass murder. Seventy or more individuals at Jonestown were injected with poison, and a third of the victims (304) were minors. Guards armed with guns and crossbows had been ordered to shoot those who fled the Jonestown pavilion as Jones lobbied for suicide.Jonestown resulted in the largest single loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act until September 11, 2001.","{1025, 4611, 6, 1031, 7, 2568, 523, 1041, 2579, 2069, 1559, 1562, 4123, 28, 33, 1058, 4643, 550, 1576, 3625, 1583, 4154, 4671, 2119, 595, 2131, 3167, 1633, 3682, 4199, 3180, 3702, 2169, 2171, 128, 1153, 1162, 3228, 1183, 4255, 2721, 2210, 2217, 173, 2221, 4800, 198, 202, 1740, 4307, 1251, 3299, 1765, 4324, 2793, 2794, 748, 3833, 3322, 1275, 257, 3842, 1795, 1804, 269, 273, 1299, 287, 290, 3877, 1830, 310, 1847, 4920, 826, 1865, 2896, 2388, 1372, 861, 873, 4971, 1388, 2415, 889, 3451, 4990, 895, 4480, 3457, 386, 3459, 1925, 1414, 391, 903, 2955, 5003, 3989, 1432, 3489, 418, 423, 4007, 4024, 1466, 1990, 967, 2507, 2509, 5074, 471, 2529, 2018, 1508, 997, 2026, 4589, 1526, 1015, 504, 4601, 4605}",123,"['Jonestown', 'Guyana', 'the Peoples Temple', 'Jim Jones', 'The Peoples Temple Agricultural Project', 'Jonestown', 'the Peoples Temple', 'Jim Jones', 'Guayana Esequiba', 'Guyana', 'Venezuela', 'November 18, 1978', 'Port Kaituma', 'Temple', 'Georgetown', 'Guyana', 'Jonestown', 'Jones', 'Peoples Temple', 'Jonestown', 'Temple', 'Port Kaituma', 'United States', 'Leo Ryan', 'Jones', 'Temple', 'Georgetown', 'Jonestown', 'Georgetown', 'today', 'Jonestown', 'Jonestown', 'Jones', 'Jonestown', 'American', 'September 11, 2001']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE']"
314,1978,January,8,"TV series ""All Creatures Great and Small"" debuts on BBC TV, based on the books by James Herriot, starring Robert hardy and Christopher Timothy",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Creatures_Great_and_Small_(TV_series),"All Creatures Great and Small is a British television series based on the books of the British veterinary surgeon Alf Wight, who wrote under the pseudonym James Herriot. 
In early 1977, the BBC tasked producer Bill Sellars with the creation of a television series from Herriot's first two novels, If Only They Could Talk and It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet, using the title of the 1975 film adaptation.  It is part of a series of movies and television series based on Herriot's novels.
The Herriot novels were written in an episodic style, with each chapter generally containing a short story within the ongoing narrative of Herriot's life. This format greatly facilitated their adaptation for a television series.
The series had two runs: the original (1978 to 1980, based directly on Herriot's books) was for three series; the second (1988 to 1990, filmed with original scripts) for four. A total of ninety episodes were broadcast.

316,1978,October,25,"""Halloween"", directed by John Carpenter, starring Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis in her film debut, is released",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_(1978_film),"Halloween is a 1978 American horror film directed and scored by John Carpenter, co-written with producer Debra Hill, and starring Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis in her film debut. The plot tells about a mental patient who was committed to a sanitarium for murdering his teenage sister on Halloween night when he was six years old. Fifteen years later, he escapes and returns to his hometown, where he stalks a female babysitter and her friends, while under pursuit by his psychiatrist.
Filming took place in Southern California in May 1978, before premiering in October, where it grossed $70 million, becoming one of the most profitable independent films. Primarily praised for Carpenter's direction and score, many credit the film as the first in a long line of slasher films inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) and Bob Clark's Black Christmas (1974). Some critics have suggested that Halloween may encourage sadism and misogyny by audiences identifying with its villain. Others have suggested that the film is a social critique of the immorality of youth and teenagers in 1970s America, with many of Myers' victims being sexually promiscuous substance abusers, and the lone heroine is depicted as innocent and pure, hence her survival. Carpenter dismisses such analyses.
Halloween spawned a film franchise comprising eleven films which helped construct an extensive backstory for its antagonist Michael Myers, sometimes narratively diverging entirely from previous installments. A remake was released in 2007, which was followed by a sequel in 2009. An eleventh installment, which serves as a direct sequel to the original film that retcons all previous sequels, was released in 2018. Another sequel to that installment, Halloween Kills, is scheduled for release on October 16, 2020. Additionally, a novelization, a video game and comic book series have been based on the film. In 2006, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""","{2018, 901, 3180, 2258, 1847, 5022}",6,"['Halloween', 'John Carpenter', 'Donald Pleasence', 'Jamie Lee Curtis', 'Halloween', '1978', 'American', 'John Carpenter', 'Debra Hill', 'Donald Pleasence', 'Jamie Lee Curtis', 'six years old', 'Fifteen years later', 'Southern California', 'May 1978', 'October', 'Carpenter', ""Alfred Hitchcock's"", 'Psycho', '1960', ""Bob Clark's"", 'Black Christmas', '1974', 'Halloween', '1970s', 'America', 'Myers', 'Carpenter', 'Halloween', 'Michael Myers', '2007', '2009', '2018', 'Halloween Kills', 'October 16, 2020', '2006', 'the United States National Film Registry', 'Congress']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG']"

Turner rose to prominence as part of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue before launching a successful career as a solo performer. One of the best-selling recording artists of all time, she has been referred to as The Queen of Rock 'n' Roll and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. Turner is noted for her energetic stage presence, powerful vocals, and career longevity.
Turner began her career in 1958 as a featured singer with Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm, recording under the name ""Little Ann"" on ""Boxtop"". Her introduction to the public as Tina Turner began with the hit single ""A Fool in Love"" (1960), released by the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. She married Ike Turner in 1962. Success followed with a string of notable hits, including ""River Deep – Mountain High"" (1966), the Grammy-winning ""Proud Mary"" (1971), and ""Nutbush City Limits"" (1973). Raised a Baptist, she became an adherent of Nichiren Buddhism in 1973, crediting the spiritual chant of Nam Myoho Renge Kyo with helping her to endure during difficult times. Turner separated from Ike Turner in 1976, ending both their personal relationship and their musical partnership; the couple divorced in 1978. In her autobiography, I, Tina: My Life Story (1986), Turner revealed that Ike Turner had subjected her to domestic violence.
In the 1980s, Turner launched a major comeback as a solo artist. The 1983 single ""Let's Stay Together"" was followed by the release of her fifth solo album, Private Dancer (1984), which became a worldwide success. The album contained the hit song ""What's Love Got to Do with It"" (1984). Turner won the Grammy Award for Record Of The Year for the single, and it became her first (and only) No. 1 hit in the United States. Turner's solo success continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s with multi-platinum albums and hit singles. Her U.S. Top 10 hits from this period include ""Better Be Good to Me"" (1984), ""Private Dancer"" (1984), ""We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)"" (1985), ""Typical Male"" (1986), and ""I Don't Wanna Fight"" (1993). In 1993, What's Love Got to Do with It, a biographical film adapted from Turner's autobiography, was released along with an accompanying soundtrack album. Turner also achieved success as an actress in films such as the 1975 rock musical Tommy, the 1985 action film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and the 1993 film Last Action Hero.
Turner has won 12 Grammy Awards; those awards include eight competitive awards, three Grammy Hall of Fame awards, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

332,1979,February,1,Ayatollah Khomeini returns to Iran after 15 years in exile,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhollah_Khomeini,"Sayyid Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini (UK:  khom-AY-nee, US:  khohm-; Persian: سید روح‌الله موسوی خمینی‎ [ɾuːholˈlɒːhe xomejˈniː] (listen); 24 September 1902 – 3 June 1989), also known in the Western world as Ayatollah Khomeini, was an Iranian politician, revolutionary, and cleric. He was the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which saw the overthrow of the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and the end of the 2,500 year old Persian monarchy. Following the revolution, Khomeini became the country's Supreme Leader, a position created in the constitution of the Islamic Republic as the highest-ranking political and religious authority of the nation, which he held until his death. He was succeeded by Ali Khamenei on 4 June 1989.
Khomeini was born in 1902 in Khomeyn, in what is now Iran's Markazi Province. His father was murdered in 1903 when Khomeini was five months old. He began studying the Quran and the Persian language from a young age and was assisted in his religious studies by his relatives, including his mother's cousin and older brother.
Khomeini was a marja (""source of emulation"") in Twelver Shia Islam, a Mujtahid or faqih (an expert in Sharia) and author of more than 40 books, but he is primarily known for his political activities. He spent more than 15 years in exile for his opposition to the last shah. In his writings and preachings he expanded the theory of welayat-el faqih, the ""Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist (clerical authority)"", to include theocratic political rule by Islamic jurists. This principle (though not known to the wider public before the revolution), was appended to the new Iranian constitution after being put to a referendum. According to The New York Times, Khomeini called democracy the equivalent of prostitution. Whether Khomeini's ideas are compatible with democracy and whether he intended the Islamic Republic to be democratic is disputed. He was Time magazine's Man of the Year in 1979 for his international influence, and Khomeini has been described as the ""virtual face of Shia Islam in Western popular culture"". In 1982, he survived one military coup attempt. Khomeini was known for his support of the hostage takers during the Iran hostage crisis, his fatwa calling for the murder of British Indian novelist Salman Rushdie, and for referring to the United States as the ""Great Satan"" and Soviet Union as the ""Lesser Satan."" Khomeini has been criticized for these acts and for human rights violations of Iranians (including his ordering of execution of thousands of political prisoners, war criminals and prisoners of the Iran–Iraq War).He has also been lauded as a ""charismatic leader of immense popularity"", a ""champion of Islamic revival"" by Shia scholars, who attempted to establish good relations between Sunnis and Shias, and a major innovator in political theory and religious-oriented populist political strategy. Khomeini held the title of Grand Ayatollah and is officially known as Imam Khomeini inside Iran and by his supporters internationally. He is generally referred to as Ayatollah Khomeini by others. In Iran, his gold-domed tomb in Tehran's Behesht-e Zahrāʾ cemetery has become a shrine for his adherents, and he is legally considered ""inviolable"", with Iranians regularly punished for insulting him.","{2561, 1539, 2052, 7, 2568, 521, 3083, 2060, 2573, 3596, 4113, 3090, 1555, 1562, 3612, 2078, 1058, 3621, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4140, 3630, 1584, 565, 4661, 2104, 1081, 2112, 66, 3139, 580, 4675, 1616, 593, 4688, 1622, 2647, 3159, 2649, 3163, 4192, 2152, 3693, 1646, 1649, 628, 2169, 2682, 2170, 3195, 127, 640, 2703, 144, 3727, 1177, 154, 2213, 1703, 682, 1706, 3243, 1709, 174, 4785, 3261, 2240, 3777, 4307, 3285, 3804, 3805, 4829, 3808, 4832, 4833, 3813, 3814, 3303, 4330, 2796, 240, 4854, 3322, 1275, 3842, 771, 1795, 1292, 1808, 281, 1307, 4895, 3874, 294, 4905, 3371, 3886, 2355, 2872, 4920, 4923, 1341, 3903, 1857, 326, 2886, 4937, 2891, 4430, 4942, 1360, 2388, 3413, 854, 3927, 4445, 1888, 353, 1386, 4971, 4472, 889, 890, 3451, 892, 4993, 4994, 3459, 903, 2955, 3979, 2964, 3989, 3483, 2982, 4010, 2475, 4526, 3508, 4020, 1464, 2489, 3002, 4024, 5059, 452, 964, 3524, 4037, 5067, 2508, 1997, 1486, 2002, 4563, 2004, 5077, 5079, 3034, 1501, 478, 1502, 492, 4589, 494, 5107, 2040, 3578, 4092, 4605}",173,"['Ayatollah Khomeini', 'Iran', '15 years', 'Sayyid Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini', 'UK', 'US', 'Persian', '24 September 1902', 'Ayatollah Khomeini', 'Iranian', 'the Islamic Republic of Iran', 'the 1979 Iranian Revolution', 'Iran', 'Mohammad Reza Pahlavi', '2,500 year', 'Persian', 'Khomeini', 'Supreme Leader', 'the Islamic Republic', 'Ali Khamenei', '4 June 1989', 'Khomeini', '1902', 'Khomeyn', 'Iran', 'Markazi Province', '1903', 'Khomeini', 'five months old', 'Quran', 'Persian', 'Khomeini', 'Shia Islam', 'Mujtahid', 'Sharia', 'more than 15 years', 'the ""Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist (clerical authority', 'Islamic', 'Iranian', 'The New York Times', 'Khomeini', 'Khomeini', 'the Islamic Republic', 'Time', '1979', 'Khomeini', 'Shia', '1982', 'Khomeini', 'Iran', 'British', 'Indian', 'Salman Rushdie', 'the United States', 'Soviet Union', 'Khomeini', 'Iranians', 'Iran', 'Iraq', 'Islamic', 'Shia', 'Sunnis', 'Shias', 'Khomeini', 'Grand Ayatollah', 'Imam Khomeini', 'Iran', 'Ayatollah Khomeini', 'Iran', 'Tehran', 'Iranians']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP']"

The unpopular President Milton Obote was overthrown in a coup d'état in 1971 by General Idi Amin, who established a military dictatorship. Amin was overthrown in 1979 following the Uganda-Tanzania War, but his loyalists started the Bush War by launching an insurgency in the West Nile region in 1980. Subsequent elections saw Obote return to power in an UNLA-ruled government. Several opposition groups claimed the elections were rigged, and united as the NRA under the leadership of Yoweri Museveni to start an armed uprising against Obote's government on 6 February 1981. Obote was overthrown and replaced as President by his general Tito Okello in 1985 during the closing months of the conflict. Okello formed a coalition government consisting of his followers and several armed opposition groups which agreed to a peace deal. In contrast, the NRA refused to compromise with the government, and conquered much of western and southern Uganda in a number of offensives from August to December 1985.
The NRA captured Kampala, Uganda's capital, in January 1986. It subsequently established a new government with Museveni as President, while the UNLA fully disintegrated in March 1986. Obote and Okello went into exile. Despite the nominal end of the civil war, numerous anti-NRA rebel factions and militias remained active, and would continue to fight Museveni's government in the next decades.","{640, 4994, 3842, 2052, 3970, 7, 2055, 2568, 2955, 3468, 3979, 2702, 2703, 3727, 4235, 1938, 1555, 2322, 3091, 3989, 3481, 4895, 4768, 290, 2210, 4134, 807, 1576, 4905, 4143, 4407, 4536, 2875, 4539, 4413, 3520, 577, 452, 4549, 967, 2122, 971, 1483, 2507, 4426, 4430, 4682, 4815, 3154, 467, 595, 3795, 1622, 4307, 5077, 3804, 1502, 889, 4704, 3046, 3686, 4971, 3180, 625, 1649, 3322, 2040, 2169, 4474, 3451, 4605}",71,"['Tanzanian', 'Kampala', 'Uganda', 'Ugandan', 'Idi Amin', 'Libya', 'The Ugandan Bush War', 'the Luwero War', 'the Ugandan Civil War', 'the Resistance War', 'Uganda', 'Ugandan', 'the Uganda National Liberation Army', 'UNLA', 'the National Resistance Army', 'NRA', '1980 to 1986', 'Milton Obote', '1971', 'Idi Amin', '1979', 'the Uganda-Tanzania War', 'the Bush War', 'the West Nile', '1980', 'UNLA', 'NRA', 'Yoweri', 'Obote', '6 February 1981', 'Tito Okello', '1985', 'the closing months', 'NRA', 'Uganda', 'August to December 1985', 'NRA', 'Kampala', 'Uganda', 'January 1986', 'Museveni', 'UNLA', 'March 1986', 'Okello', 'Museveni', 'the next decades']","['NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'EVENT', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"
334,1979,May,4,Margaret Thatcher becomes the first woman to be elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher,"Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher,  (née Roberts; 13 October 1925 – 8 April 2013) was a British stateswoman who served as prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990. She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to hold that office. A Soviet journalist dubbed her ""The Iron Lady"", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies known as Thatcherism.
Thatcher studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, and worked briefly as a research chemist, before becoming a barrister. She was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her secretary of state for education and science in his 1970–74 government. In 1975, she defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become leader of the Opposition, the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. On becoming prime minister after winning the 1979 general election, Thatcher introduced a series of economic policies intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Her popularity in her first years in office waned amid recession and rising unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her landslide re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt by the Provisional IRA in the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing and achieved a political victory against the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1984–85 miners' strike.
Thatcher was re-elected for a third term with another landslide in 1987, but her subsequent support for the Community Charge (""poll tax"") was widely unpopular, and her increasingly Eurosceptic views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as prime minister and party leader in November 1990, after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership (characterised by journalist Simon Heffer as ""a rare coup d’état at the top of the British politics: the first since Lloyd George sawed Asquith off at the knees in 1916"").
After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher (of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. In 2013, she died of a stroke at the Ritz Hotel in London, at the age of 87.
Although a controversial figure in British political culture, Thatcher is nonetheless viewed favourably in historical rankings of British prime ministers. Her tenure constituted a realignment towards neoliberal policies in the United Kingdom and debate over the complicated legacy of Thatcherism persists into the 21st century.","{4097, 2051, 7, 1547, 524, 3090, 1566, 34, 1058, 4642, 4134, 1576, 1584, 561, 4661, 2104, 2112, 1602, 1095, 3154, 595, 1622, 2649, 2141, 2152, 1646, 1136, 1649, 2169, 2171, 127, 640, 4736, 4235, 1678, 2703, 3727, 1170, 1177, 4768, 1185, 2210, 1699, 2721, 1706, 3243, 1709, 174, 176, 4785, 2740, 698, 3777, 1739, 3795, 4307, 3799, 4825, 3803, 4829, 3812, 3813, 4330, 4845, 3834, 3322, 3842, 4879, 3862, 4895, 290, 2339, 3874, 3365, 4899, 2856, 4905, 1835, 815, 2875, 4413, 2379, 2891, 4940, 4430, 3413, 3927, 1888, 1890, 4967, 4971, 4472, 889, 3451, 892, 4993, 4994, 387, 900, 3459, 1929, 3978, 2955, 3979, 1432, 4526, 2483, 4020, 4536, 1465, 1979, 452, 964, 3524, 4549, 971, 2507, 2508, 4561, 467, 4563, 5077, 2525, 1502, 1517, 2039, 3578, 4605}",128,"['Margaret Thatcher', 'the United Kingdom', 'Margaret Hilda Thatcher', 'Baroness Thatcher', 'Roberts', '13 October 1925', 'April 2013', 'British', 'the United Kingdom', '1979 to 1990', 'the Conservative Party', '1975 to 1990', 'British', 'the 20th century', 'Soviet', 'The Iron Lady', 'Thatcher', 'Somerville College', 'Oxford', 'Parliament', 'Finchley', '1959', 'Edward Heath', '1975', 'Conservative Party', 'Opposition', 'the United Kingdom', '1979', 'Thatcher', 'Britain', 'the Winter of Discontent', 'her first years', '1982', 'Falklands War', '1983', 'the Provisional IRA', '1984', 'Brighton', 'the National Union of Mineworkers', 'Thatcher', '1987', 'Eurosceptic', 'the European Community', 'Cabinet', 'November 1990', 'Michael Heseltine', 'Simon Heffer', 'British', 'Lloyd George', '1916', 'Commons', '1992', 'Thatcher', 'Kesteven', 'the County of Lincolnshire', 'the House of Lords', '2013', 'the Ritz Hotel', 'London', 'the age of 87', 'British', 'Thatcher', 'British', 'the United Kingdom', 'the 21st century']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE']"

However, the infrastructure which delivers energy services can break down in an energy accident, sometimes causing much damage, and energy fatalities can occur, and with many systems often deaths will happen even when the systems are working as intended.
Historically, coal mining has been the most dangerous energy activity and the list of historical coal mining disasters is a long one. Underground mining hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and gas explosions. Open cut mining hazards are principally mine wall failures and vehicle collisions. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners have been killed in accidents over the past century, with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone.According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, 279 major energy accidents occurred from 1907 to 2007 and they caused 182,156 deaths with $41 billion in property damages, with these figures not including deaths from smaller accidents.However, by far the greatest energy fatalities that result from energy generation by humanity, is the creation of air pollution. The most lethal of which, particulate matter, which is primarily generated from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass is (counting outdoor air pollution effects only) estimated to cause 2.1 to 4.21 million deaths annually.","{4994, 771, 2052, 3083, 1292, 3979, 144, 528, 154, 4895, 1058, 39, 551, 2601, 3630, 1584, 4913, 2104, 1081, 1341, 3903, 1857, 3777, 3139, 452, 964, 5059, 4807, 5067, 2508, 1997, 4941, 5079, 3034, 3804, 478, 4192, 2152, 1386, 4330, 4718, 1783, 4472, 2297, 3195, 4991}",46,"['the Gulf of Mexico', 'US', 'the past century', '1907', 'Benjamin K.

Crime of the Century was Supertramp's commercial breakthrough in both the US and UK, aided by the UK hit ""Dreamer"" and the US hit ""Bloody Well Right"". It was a UK Top 10 album and a US Top 40 album, eventually being certified Gold in the US in 1977 after the release of Even in the Quietest Moments.... The album was Supertramp's first to feature drummer Bob Siebenberg (at the time credited as Bob C.

During the Second World War, he was Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command (1943–1946). He was the last Viceroy of India (1947) and the first governor-general of independent India (1947–1948).
From 1954 to 1959, Mountbatten was First Sea Lord, a position that had been held by his father, Prince Louis of Battenberg, some forty years earlier. Thereafter he served as chief of the Defence Staff until 1965, making him the longest-serving professional head of the British Armed Forces to date. During this period Mountbatten also served as chairman of the NATO Military Committee for a year.
In August 1979, Mountbatten was assassinated by a bomb that was hidden aboard his fishing boat in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, Ireland, by members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army.","{7, 3093, 1566, 1058, 3621, 1576, 4140, 1584, 565, 4661, 1591, 2104, 4671, 2112, 580, 69, 70, 1095, 75, 1622, 2141, 608, 1121, 1635, 1125, 2152, 3693, 1136, 2171, 127, 640, 4235, 3727, 144, 2718, 4768, 2210, 3243, 3244, 1709, 174, 176, 4785, 2743, 703, 3777, 3795, 4307, 4829, 734, 2274, 3812, 3813, 3814, 4330, 3322, 3842, 4871, 782, 2332, 4895, 3874, 3365, 295, 4905, 2355, 311, 4413, 4430, 2388, 3413, 854, 1888, 1890, 4971, 370, 375, 4472, 889, 3451, 892, 4993, 4994, 387, 2955, 3979, 5003, 3989, 3483, 2982, 2475, 1452, 4526, 3508, 1979, 1475, 452, 964, 3524, 4051, 2004, 4563, 3542, 5077, 2525, 1502, 4589, 3578, 2555, 4605}",110,"['1st Earl Mountbatten', 'Burma', 'Queen Elizabeth II', 'Viceroy', 'India', 'IRA', 'Sligo', 'Ireland', 'Nicholas Mountbatten', 'Earl Mountbatten', 'Burma', 'Prince Louis of Battenberg', '25 June 1900', '1979', 'British', 'Royal Navy', 'Prince Philip', 'Edinburgh', 'Queen Elizabeth II', 'the Second World War', 'Supreme Allied', 'South East Asia Command', 'Viceroy', 'India', '1947', 'India', '1954 to 1959', 'Mountbatten', 'First Sea Lord', 'Prince Louis of Battenberg', 'some forty years earlier', 'the Defence Staff', '1965', 'the British Armed Forces', 'Mountbatten', 'the NATO Military Committee', 'a year', 'August 1979', 'Mountbatten', 'Mullaghmore, County Sligo', 'Ireland', 'the Provisional Irish Republican Army']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG']"

French scholar Marie-France Toinet says use of the term ""anti-Americanism"" is ""only fully justified if it implies systematic opposition – a sort of allergic reaction – to America as a whole.""Discussions on anti-Americanism have in most cases lacked a precise explanation of what the sentiment entails (other than a general disfavor), which has led to the term being used broadly and in an impressionistic manner, resulting in the inexact impressions of the many expressions described as anti-American.

It was also directed by Jones. The film tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Chapman), a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as—and next door to—Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.
Following the withdrawal of funding by EMI Films just days before production was scheduled to begin, long-time Monty Python fan and former member of the Beatles, George Harrison, arranged financing for Life of Brian through the formation of his company HandMade Films.The film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release, drawing accusations of blasphemy, and protests from some religious groups. Thirty-nine local authorities in the United Kingdom either imposed an outright ban, or imposed an X (18 years) certificate, effectively preventing the film from being shown, since the distributors said it could not be shown unless it was unedited and carried the original AA (14) certificate. Some countries, including Ireland and Norway, banned its showing, with a few of these bans lasting decades. The filmmakers used such notoriety to benefit their marketing campaign, with posters in Sweden reading, ""So funny, it was banned in Norway!""The film was a box office success, the fourth-highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom in 1979, and highest grossing of any British film in the United States that year. It has remained popular, receiving positive reviews. The film was named ""greatest comedy film of all time"" by several magazines and television networks, and it later received a 95% ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus, ""One of the more cutting-edge films of the 1970s, this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.""

341,1979,December,7,"""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" first movie of the series premieres directed by Robert Wise, starring William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Motion_Picture,"Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a 1979 American science fiction film directed by Robert Wise and based on the television series Star Trek created by Gene Roddenberry, who also served as its producer. It is the first installment in the Star Trek film series, and stars the cast of the original television series. In the film, set in the 2270s, a mysterious and immensely powerful alien cloud known as V'Ger approaches Earth, destroying everything in its path. Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) assumes command of the recently refitted Starship USS Enterprise, to lead it on a mission to save the planet and determine V'Ger's origins.
When the original television series was canceled in 1969, Roddenberry lobbied Paramount Pictures to continue the franchise through a feature film. The success of the series in syndication convinced the studio to begin work on the film in 1975. A series of writers attempted to craft a ""suitably epic"" script, but the attempts did not satisfy Paramount, who scrapped the project in 1977. Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots, with a new television series titled Star Trek: Phase II. The box office success of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, however, convinced Paramount that science fiction films other than Star Wars could do well, so the studio canceled production of Phase II and resumed its attempts at making a Star Trek film.
In 1978, Paramount assembled the largest press conference held at the studio since the 1950s to announce that Wise would direct a $15 million film adaptation of the original television series. With the cancellation of Phase II, writers rushed to adapt its planned pilot episode, ""In Thy Image"", into a film script. Constant revisions to the story and the shooting script continued to the extent of hourly script updates on shooting dates. The Enterprise was modified inside and out, costume designer Robert Fletcher provided new uniforms, and production designer Harold Michelson fabricated new sets. Jerry Goldsmith composed the film's score, beginning an association with Star Trek that would continue until 2002. When the original contractors for the optical effects proved unable to complete their tasks in time, effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull was given carte blanche to meet the film's December 1979 release date. The film came together only days before the premiere; Wise took the just-completed film to its Washington, D.C., opening, but always felt that the final theatrical version was a rough cut of the film he wanted to make.
Released in North America on December 7, 1979, Star Trek: The Motion Picture received mixed reviews, many of which faulted it for a lack of action scenes and over-reliance on special effects. Its final production cost ballooned to approximately $45 million, and it earned $139 million worldwide, short of studio expectations but enough for Paramount to propose a less expensive sequel. Roddenberry was forced out of creative control for the sequel, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982). In 2001, Wise oversaw a director's cut for a special DVD release of the film, with remastered audio, tightened and added scenes, and new computer-generated effects.","{1025, 4611, 7, 2568, 4113, 3612, 1058, 4134, 1576, 4138, 1583, 1584, 2104, 1084, 4671, 576, 580, 1095, 586, 1616, 2645, 1622, 2647, 603, 3676, 1633, 2152, 1649, 2169, 640, 1153, 1162, 3722, 4235, 2703, 3727, 4768, 1192, 1706, 3252, 703, 4287, 3777, 1732, 1222, 3272, 2763, 4307, 2261, 1757, 2274, 1251, 2278, 743, 2793, 234, 748, 1272, 3322, 1275, 3842, 1795, 1288, 3864, 1821, 4895, 290, 1319, 4905, 4400, 4920, 826, 2875, 4413, 1343, 2884, 843, 2388, 2901, 4437, 4445, 4971, 2415, 375, 889, 3451, 893, 4477, 4990, 4993, 4994, 3459, 900, 2955, 1424, 5010, 3989, 1432, 5019, 418, 4007, 936, 5033, 4024, 4536, 442, 1979, 4547, 452, 453, 964, 4549, 1483, 2507, 4558, 463, 2514, 2004, 5077, 3036, 990, 1502, 1508, 3046, 2026, 4589, 3578, 4605}",128,"['Star Trek: The Motion Picture', 'Robert Wise', 'William Shatner', 'Leonard Nimoy', 'Star Trek:', '1979', 'American', 'Robert Wise', 'Star Trek', 'Gene Roddenberry', 'the Star Trek film series', 'the 2270s', 'Earth', 'James T.

342,1979,May,8,"The Cure release their debut album ""Three Imaginary Boys"" (Boys Don't Cry in US, Australia)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure,"The Cure are an English rock band formed in Crawley, West Sussex, in 1978. The band members have changed several times, with guitarist, lead vocalist and songwriter Robert Smith the only constant member. The band's debut album was Three Imaginary Boys (1979) and this, along with several early singles, placed the band in the post-punk and new wave movements that had sprung up in the wake of the punk rock revolution in the United Kingdom. Beginning with their second album, Seventeen Seconds (1980), the band adopted a new, increasingly dark and tormented style, which, together with Smith's stage look, had a strong influence on the emerging genre of gothic rock as well as the subculture which eventually formed around the genre.
Following the release of the album Pornography in 1982, the band's future was uncertain. Smith was keen to move past the gloomy reputation his band had acquired, introducing a greater pop sensibility into the band's music. Songs such as ""Let's Go to Bed"" (1982), ""Just Like Heaven"" (1987), ""Lovesong"" (1989), and ""Friday I'm in Love"" (1992) aided the band in receiving commercial popularity. The band have released 13 studio albums, two EPs and over 30 singles to date.
The Cure were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.","{4101, 7, 2568, 521, 4113, 3090, 2589, 2078, 1573, 4134, 4647, 1576, 2601, 1583, 2096, 1092, 2628, 2119, 2122, 4682, 4688, 3154, 595, 1622, 2649, 3163, 607, 619, 2155, 3180, 3693, 1136, 1649, 1653, 2169, 2170, 2682, 3195, 640, 1153, 1162, 2191, 2703, 3727, 4758, 4768, 2210, 2213, 2214, 1192, 1706, 2740, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 3285, 4313, 3804, 3805, 3808, 1251, 3303, 2793, 2794, 2798, 3322, 1275, 4859, 3842, 4879, 1808, 2322, 3869, 4895, 294, 807, 810, 4402, 4916, 311, 4920, 2875, 3903, 4940, 4430, 4942, 2388, 2901, 1369, 4971, 1388, 2415, 2929, 889, 4474, 3451, 4993, 3970, 3460, 2955, 1422, 4498, 1432, 418, 4014, 2995, 4024, 4539, 5059, 4549, 5062, 967, 5065, 971, 2507, 1997, 2508, 5074, 5077, 3034, 1502, 3040, 1508, 2026, 492, 4589, 5106, 5107, 1526, 2040, 4605, 1022}",135,"['Cure', 'Three Imaginary Boys', 'US', 'Australia', 'Cure', 'English', 'Crawley', 'West Sussex', '1978', 'Robert Smith', '1979', 'the United Kingdom', '1980', 'Smith', 'Pornography', '1982', ""Let's Go to Bed"", '1982', 'Just Like Heaven', '1987', 'Lovesong', '1989', ""Friday I'm in Love"", '1992', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame', '2019']","['ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LANGUAGE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE']"

344,1979,November,23,"Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" released, sells 6 million copies in 2 weeks",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall,"The Wall is the eleventh studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd, released 30 November 1979 on Harvest and Columbia Records. It is a rock opera that explores Pink, a jaded rockstar whose eventual self-imposed isolation from society is symbolized by a wall. The album was a commercial success, topping the US charts for 15 weeks, and reaching number three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but later came to be considered one of the greatest albums of all time.
Bassist Roger Waters conceived The Wall during Pink Floyd's 1977 In The Flesh tour, modeling the character of Pink after himself and former bandmate Syd Barrett. Recording spanned from December 1978 to November 1979. Producer Bob Ezrin helped to refine the concept and bridge tensions during recording, as the band were struggling with personal and financial issues at the time. The Wall is the last album to feature Pink Floyd as a quartet; keyboardist Richard Wright was fired by Waters during production, but stayed on as a salaried musician. Three singles were issued from the album: ""Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2"" (the band's only US number-one single), ""Run Like Hell"", and ""Comfortably Numb"". From 1980 to 1981, Pink Floyd performed the full album on a tour that featured elaborate theatrical effects.
The Wall was adapted into a 1982 feature film of the same name and remains one of the best-known concept albums.. The album has sold more than 24 million copies, is the second best-selling in the band's catalog, and is one of the best-selling of all time. Some of the outtakes from the recording sessions were later used on the group's next album, The Final Cut (1983). In 2000 it was voted number 30 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2003, Rolling Stone listed The Wall at number 87 on its list of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"". From 2010 to 2013, Waters staged a new Wall live tour that became the highest-grossing tour by a solo musician.","{2568, 521, 3083, 528, 4113, 3090, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1566, 1058, 4134, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4647, 3630, 1584, 2104, 1081, 1090, 3139, 2628, 4688, 3154, 1622, 2649, 2652, 4192, 2152, 2155, 1136, 1649, 2169, 3195, 640, 2176, 131, 2703, 144, 3727, 154, 4768, 2721, 2210, 677, 2213, 1706, 690, 703, 3777, 4807, 2764, 717, 3277, 4300, 3795, 4307, 4313, 4825, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3303, 744, 4330, 2798, 1783, 2297, 1275, 771, 1292, 1808, 3869, 4895, 290, 4899, 3365, 294, 2856, 4905, 4916, 309, 311, 2875, 1341, 3901, 3903, 1857, 3908, 2891, 4941, 4942, 2388, 1386, 4971, 4472, 4474, 4990, 4480, 4993, 386, 387, 900, 3460, 3970, 4994, 2955, 3979, 401, 1938, 3989, 1432, 3999, 4014, 4536, 2489, 1979, 963, 452, 964, 4549, 5059, 5065, 971, 1483, 1997, 2507, 2508, 5067, 4561, 5077, 5079, 3544, 3034, 1502, 3040, 3046, 492, 4589, 5106, 5107, 2040, 3578, 4605}",146,"['Floyd', 'The Wall', '2 weeks', 'English', 'Pink Floyd', 'November 1979', 'Harvest', 'Columbia Records', 'US', '15 weeks', 'UK', 'Bassist', 'Roger Waters', '1977', 'Flesh', 'Syd Barrett', 'December 1978 to November 1979', 'Bob Ezrin', 'Pink Floyd', 'Richard Wright', 'Another Brick in the Wall', 'US', 'Run Like Hell', 'Comfortably Numb', '1980 to 1981', 'Floyd', 'Wall', '1982', 'The Final Cut', '1983', '2000', ""Colin Larkin's"", 'All Time Top 1000 Albums', '2003', 'Rolling Stone', '2010', '2013', 'Waters']","['PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG']"

Summerall played football for the Arkansas Razorbacks and then in the National Football League (NFL) from 1952 through 1961. He was drafted by the Detroit Lions and played with Bobby Layne. The best playing time in his career was with the New York Giants as a kicker. After retiring as a player, he joined CBS as a color commentator the next year. He worked with Tom Brookshier and then John Madden on NFL telecasts for CBS and Fox. Although retired since 2002, he continued to announce games on occasion, especially those near his Texas home.
He was named the National Sportscaster of the Year by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association in 1977, and inducted into their Hall of Fame in 1994.

352,1980,May,5,Siege at Iranian Embassy in London ends as the SAS and police storm the building,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Embassy_siege,"The Iranian Embassy siege took place from 30 April to 5 May 1980, after a group of six armed men stormed the Iranian embassy on Prince's Gate in South Kensington, London. The gunmen, members of Arabs of KSA group campaigning for Arab national sovereignty in the southern Iranian region of Khuzestan Province, took 26 people hostage, mostly embassy staff, but also several visitors, as well as a police officer who had been guarding the embassy. They demanded the release of Arab prisoners from prisons in Khuzestan and their own safe passage out of the United Kingdom. The British government quickly decided that safe passage would not be granted and a siege ensued. Subsequently, police negotiators secured the release of five hostages in exchange for minor concessions, such as the broadcasting of the hostage-takers' demands on British television.
By the sixth day of the siege the gunmen had become increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress in meeting their demands. That evening, they killed one of the hostages and threw his body out of the embassy. As a result, the government ordered the Special Air Service (SAS), a special forces regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault, known as Operation Nimrod, to rescue the remaining hostages. Shortly afterwards, SAS soldiers abseiled from the roof of the building and forced entry through the windows. During the 17-minute raid, they rescued all but one of the remaining hostages, and killed five of the six hostage-takers. The soldiers later faced accusations of unnecessarily killing two of the five, but an inquest into the deaths eventually cleared the SAS of any wrongdoing. The sole remaining gunman was prosecuted and served 27 years in British prisons.
The hostage-takers and their cause were largely forgotten after the Iran–Iraq War broke out later that year and the hostage crisis in Tehran continued until January 1981. Nonetheless, the operation brought the SAS to the public eye for the first time and bolstered the reputation of Thatcher. The SAS was quickly overwhelmed by the number of applications it received from people inspired by the operation and experienced greater demand for its expertise from foreign governments. The building, having suffered major damage from a fire that broke out during the assault, was not reopened as the Iranian embassy until 1993.","{640, 1026, 387, 7, 1288, 4871, 1162, 2955, 3979, 892, 1678, 4879, 1170, 663, 1177, 4642, 4516, 3365, 1192, 3243, 2171, 1709, 4526, 2483, 4661, 2102, 2487, 1465, 4923, 4287, 576, 2112, 452, 580, 3524, 3322, 843, 1228, 2891, 4300, 4430, 4940, 4307, 2388, 2901, 3413, 2647, 3927, 4563, 3676, 889, 1888, 1633, 1890, 1251, 1508, 3813, 2793, 2026, 4330, 3308, 4845, 1646, 4971, 1526, 2039, 4472, 2169, 3578, 3451, 2684, 4605, 127}",73,"['Iranian Embassy', 'London', 'SAS', 'Iranian', '30 April to 5 May 1980', 'Iranian', ""Prince's Gate"", 'South Kensington', 'London', 'Arabs', 'KSA', 'Arab', 'Iranian', 'Khuzestan Province', 'Arab', 'Khuzestan', 'the United Kingdom', 'British', 'British', 'the sixth day', 'the Special Air Service', 'SAS', 'the British Army', 'Operation Nimrod', 'SAS', 'SAS', '27 years', 'British', 'Iran', 'Iraq War', 'later that year', 'Tehran', 'January 1981', 'SAS', 'Thatcher', 'SAS', 'Iranian', '1993']","['FAC', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE']"
353,1980,May,8,World Health Organization announces smallpox has been eradicated,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox,"Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by one of two virus variants, Variola major and Variola minor. The last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October 1977, and the World Health Organization (WHO) certified the global eradication of the disease in 1980. The risk of death following contracting the disease was about 30%, with higher rates among babies. Often those who survived had extensive scarring of their skin, and some were left blind.The initial symptoms of the disease included fever and vomiting. This was followed by formation of sores in the mouth and a skin rash. Over a number of days the skin rash turned into characteristic fluid-filled bumps with a dent in the center. The bumps then scabbed over and fell off, leaving scars. The disease was spread between people or via contaminated objects. Prevention was by the smallpox vaccine. Once the disease had developed, certain antiviral medication may have helped.The origin of smallpox is unknown. The earliest evidence of the disease dates to the 3rd century BCE in Egyptian mummies. The disease historically occurred in outbreaks. In 18th-century Europe, it is estimated 400,000 people per year died from the disease, and one-third of the cases resulted in blindness. These deaths included four reigning monarchs and a queen consort. Smallpox is estimated to have killed up to 300 million people in the 20th century and around 500 million people in the last 100 years of its existence. As recently as 1967, 15 million cases occurred a year.Inoculation for smallpox appears to have started in China around the 1500s. Europe adopted this practice from Asia in the first half of the 18th century. In 1796 Edward Jenner introduced the modern smallpox vaccine. In 1967, the WHO intensified efforts to eliminate the disease. Smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated, the other being rinderpest in 2011. The term ""smallpox"" was first used in Britain in the early 16th century to distinguish the disease from syphilis, which was then known as the ""great pox"". Other historical names for the disease include pox, speckled monster, and red plague.","{1985, 274, 1395, 1388}",4,"['World Health Organization', 'Variola', 'Variola', 'October 1977', 'the World Health Organization', '1980', 'about 30%', 'a number of days', 'the 3rd century', 'Egyptian', '18th-century', 'Europe', 'the 20th century', 'the last 100 years', '1967', 'China', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'the first half of the 18th century', '1796', 'Edward Jenner', '1967', 'WHO', '2011', 'Britain', 'the early 16th century', 'syphilis']","['ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE']"

355,1980,September,22,Iraq invades Iran in an attempt to control the Shatt al-Arab waterway,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War,"The Iran–Iraq War (Persian: جنگ ایران و عراق‎) (Arabic: حرب الخليج الأولى‎) began on 22 September 1980, when Iraq invaded Iran, and it ended on 20 August 1988, when Iran accepted the UN-brokered ceasefire. Iraq wanted to replace Iran as the dominant Persian Gulf state, and was worried the 1979 Iranian Revolution would lead Iraq's Shi'ite majority to rebel against the Ba'athist government. The war also followed a long history of border disputes, and Iraq planned to annex the oil-rich Khuzestan Province and the east bank of the Shatt al-Arab (Arvand Rud).
Although Iraq hoped to take advantage of Iran's post-revolutionary chaos, it made limited progress and was quickly repelled; Iran regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982. For the next six years, Iran was on the offensive until near the end of the war. There were a number of proxy forces—most notably the People's Mujahedin of Iran siding with Iraq and the Iraqi Kurdish militias of the KDP and PUK siding with Iran. The United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and most Arab countries provided political and logistic support for Iraq, while Iran was largely isolated.
After eight years of war, war-exhaustion, economic devastation, decreased morale, military stalemate, international outrage against the use of weapons of mass destruction against civilians by Iraqi forces, and increased U.S.–Iran military tension all led to a ceasefire brokered by the United Nations.
The conflict has been compared to World War I in terms of the tactics used, including large-scale trench warfare with barbed wire stretched across fortified defensive lines, manned machine gun posts, bayonet charges, Iranian human wave attacks, extensive use of chemical weapons by Iraq, and, later, deliberate attacks on civilian targets. A special feature of the war can be seen in the Iranian cult of the martyr which had been developed in the years before the revolution. The discourses on martyrdom formulated in the Iranian Shiite context led to the tactics of ""human wave attacks"" and thus had a lasting impact on the dynamics of the war.An estimated 500,000 Iraqi and Iranian soldiers died, in addition to a smaller number of civilians.

357,1980,November,13,US spacecraft Voyager 1 sends back 1st close-up pictures of Saturn,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens,"The Cassini–Huygens space-research mission ( kə-SEE-nee HOY-gənz), commonly called Cassini, involved a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) to send a probe to study the planet Saturn and its system, including its rings and natural satellites. The Flagship-class robotic spacecraft comprised both NASA's Cassini probe and ESA's Huygens lander, which landed on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Cassini was the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter its orbit. The two craft took their names from the  astronomers Giovanni Cassini and Christiaan Huygens.
Launched aboard a  Titan IVB/Centaur on October 15, 1997, Cassini was active in space for nearly 20 years, with 13 years spent orbiting Saturn and studying the planet and its system after entering orbit on July 1, 2004. The voyage to Saturn included flybys of Venus (April 1998 and July 1999), Earth (August 1999), the asteroid 2685 Masursky, and Jupiter (December 2000). The mission ended on September 15, 2017, when Cassini's trajectory took it into Saturn's upper atmosphere and it burned up in order to prevent any risk of contaminating Saturn's moons, which might have offered habitable environments to stowaway terrestrial microbes on the spacecraft. The mission is widely perceived to have been successful beyond expectations. NASA's Planetary Science Division Director, Jim Green, described Cassini-Huygens as a ""mission of firsts"", that has revolutionized human understanding of the Saturn system, including its moons and rings, and our understanding of where life might be found in the Solar System.Cassini's planners originally scheduled a mission of four years, from June 2004 to May 2008. The mission was extended for another two years until September 2010, branded the Cassini Equinox Mission. The mission was extended a second and final time with the Cassini Solstice Mission, lasting another seven years until September 15, 2017, on which date Cassini was de-orbited to burn up in Saturn's upper atmosphere.
The Huygens module traveled with Cassini until its separation from the probe on December 25, 2004; it  landed by parachute on Titan on January 14, 2005. It returned data to Earth for around 90 minutes, using the orbiter as a relay. This was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System and the first landing on a moon other than Earth's Moon.
At the end of its mission, the Cassini spacecraft executed its ""Grand Finale"": a number of risky passes through the gaps between Saturn and Saturn's inner rings.
This phase aimed to maximize Cassini's scientific outcome before the spacecraft was disposed. The atmospheric entry of Cassini ended the mission, but analyses of the returned data will continue for many years.","{4101, 7, 2568, 521, 4113, 3612, 2078, 1058, 39, 1576, 2601, 3630, 1584, 2609, 4661, 2104, 1081, 2112, 3139, 4688, 595, 2645, 1622, 2137, 3163, 2141, 4192, 2152, 620, 2157, 3693, 1649, 3702, 2170, 127, 640, 3727, 144, 4768, 4775, 3243, 173, 1197, 1709, 698, 3777, 2246, 1736, 717, 1746, 3795, 4307, 3285, 4824, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3813, 3303, 4330, 3322, 1275, 3842, 1292, 1808, 1821, 4895, 2342, 3882, 302, 4916, 309, 311, 4920, 1341, 3903, 1857, 843, 2379, 2891, 4941, 4942, 2388, 3413, 1888, 1890, 1386, 4971, 375, 4472, 889, 890, 3451, 892, 893, 4477, 4986, 4990, 4993, 4994, 900, 3460, 2955, 3979, 3989, 5037, 4526, 4536, 4547, 452, 964, 3524, 5059, 5067, 2508, 1997, 2514, 4051, 5077, 5079, 987, 3036, 477, 478, 1502, 2529, 3046, 4589, 5107, 2040, 3578, 4605}",132,"['US', 'Voyager 1', 'Saturn', 'Cassini', 'Cassini', 'NASA', 'the European Space Agency', 'the Italian Space Agency', 'ASI', 'Saturn', 'Flagship', 'NASA', 'ESA', 'Saturn', 'Titan', 'Saturn', 'Giovanni Cassini', 'Christiaan Huygens', 'Titan IVB/Centaur', 'October 15, 1997', 'Cassini', 'nearly 20 years', '13 years', 'Saturn', 'July 1, 2004', 'Saturn', 'Venus', 'April 1998', 'July 1999', 'Earth', 'August 1999', '2685', 'Masursky', 'Jupiter', 'December 2000', 'September 15, 2017', 'Cassini', 'Saturn', 'Saturn', 'NASA', 'Planetary Science Division', 'Jim Green', 'Cassini-Huygens', 'Saturn', 'the Solar System', 'Cassini', 'four years', 'June 2004', 'May 2008', 'another two years', 'September 2010', 'the Cassini Solstice Mission', 'another seven years', 'September 15, 2017', 'Cassini', 'Saturn', 'Cassini', 'December 25, 2004', 'Titan', 'January 14, 2005', 'Earth', 'Solar System', 'Earth', 'Cassini', 'Grand Finale', 'Saturn', 'Saturn', 'Cassini', 'Cassini', 'many years']","['GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'PRODUCT', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PRODUCT', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE']"

The film is based on Stephen King's 1977 novel of the same name and stars Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Scatman Crothers, and Danny Lloyd.
The  central character in The Shining is Jack Torrance (Nicholson), an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic, who accepts a position as the off-season caretaker of the isolated historic Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies. Wintering over with Jack are his wife, Wendy Torrance (Duvall) and young son, Danny Torrance (Lloyd). Danny possesses ""the shining"", psychic abilities that enable him to see into the hotel's horrific past. The hotel cook, Dick Hallorann (Crothers), also has this ability and is able to communicate with Danny telepathically. The hotel had a previous winter caretaker who went insane and killed his family and himself. After a winter storm leaves the Torrances snowbound, Jack's sanity deteriorates due to the influence of the supernatural forces that inhabit the hotel, placing his wife and son in danger.
Production took place almost exclusively at EMI Elstree Studios, with sets based on real locations. Kubrick often worked with a small crew, which allowed him to do many takes, sometimes to the exhaustion of the actors and staff. The new Steadicam mount was used to shoot several scenes, giving the film an innovative and immersive look and feel. There has been much speculation into the meanings and actions in the film because of inconsistencies, ambiguities, symbolism, and differences from the book.
The film was released in the United States on May 23, 1980, and in the United Kingdom on October 2, 1980, by Warner Bros. There were several versions for theatrical releases, each of which was cut shorter than the one preceding it; about 27 minutes were cut in total. Reactions to the film at the time of its release were mixed; Stephen King criticized the film due to its deviations from the novel. Critical opinion has become more favorable and it is now widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential horror films ever made and has become a staple of pop culture. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".A sequel, Doctor Sleep, was released on November 8, 2019, in the United States, and on October 31, 2019, in Europe.

361,1980,January,11,"Debut of first The Pretenders album ""Pretenders""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretenders_(album),"Pretenders is the debut studio album by British-American band The Pretenders, released on 7 January 1980 under Real Records in the UK, and on 27 December 1979 on Sire Records in the United States. A combination of rock, punk and pop music, this album made the band famous. The album features the singles ""Stop Your Sobbing"", ""Kid"" and ""Brass in Pocket"".
Nick Lowe produced the Pretenders' first single, ""Stop Your Sobbing"", but decided not to work with them again as he thought the band was ""not going anywhere"". Chris Thomas took over on the subsequent recording sessions.
Pretenders debuted at number 1 on the UK Albums Chart in the week of its release and stayed there for four consecutive weeks. It also made the top 10 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Platinum during 1982 by the RIAA. Pretenders has been named one of the best albums of all time by VH1 (#52). In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked the album number 155 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. In 1989, the magazine ranked it the 20th best album of the 1980s. In 2012, Slant Magazine listed the album at #64 on its ""Best Albums of the 1980s"".Pretenders was remastered and re-released in 2006 and included a bonus disc of demos, B-sides and live cuts, many previously unreleased. ""Cuban Slide"" and ""Porcelain"" originally appeared as B-sides to ""Talk of the Town"" and ""Message of Love"", while ""Swinging London"" and ""Nervous But Shy"" both appeared on the flip side of ""Brass in Pocket"". The Regents Park demo of ""Stop Your Sobbing"" was included initially as a flexi-single in the May 1981 edition of Flexipop magazine. The tracks ""Message of Love"", ""Talk of the Town"", ""Porcelain"" and ""Cuban Slide"" alongside a live version of the album's opening track, ""Precious"", were released on a follow-up EP entitled Extended Play soon after.
Pretenders was also reissued in 2009 by Audio Fidelity as a limited-edition audiophile gold CD, using the original master tapes. However, this remaster suffered from unauthorized, heavy limiting supposedly applied after engineer Steve Hoffman's digital master was created and approved for CD manufacturing. The song ""The Phone Call"" is missing some of the telephone effects on this release because the effects were ""flown in"" after the master was completed for the song and, as a result, weren't on the original master tape. There were no bonus tracks included.
A shortened version of ""Tequila"" would be performed nearly 15 years later on the Last of the Independents. ""Sabre Dance"" features Chrissie Hynde singing portions of ""Stop Your Sobbing"" over lengthy solos by James Honeyman-Scott and Martin Chambers' insistent drumming, making it a truly unique version.
A cover version of ""Brass in Pocket"" and the master version of ""Precious"" are available as downloadable content for Rock Band.",set(),0,"['British-American', 'Pretenders', '7 January 1980', 'Real Records', 'UK', '27 December 1979', 'Sire Records', 'the United States', 'Stop Your Sobbing', 'Pocket', 'Nick Lowe', 'Pretenders', 'Stop Your Sobbing', 'Chris Thomas', 'the week', 'four consecutive weeks', 'Platinum', '1982', 'RIAA', 'VH1', '2003', 'Rolling Stone', '2012', '1989', 'the 1980s', '2012', 'Slant Magazine', 'Best Albums of the 1980s""', '2006', 'demos', 'Cuban', 'Porcelain', 'Talk of the Town', 'Message of Love', 'Swinging London', 'Nervous But Shy', 'Pocket', 'Regents Park', 'Stop Your Sobbing', 'May 1981', 'Flexipop', 'Message of Love', 'Talk of the Town', 'Porcelain', 'Cuban', '2009', 'Audio Fidelity', ""Steve Hoffman's"", 'The Phone Call', 'Tequila', 'nearly 15 years later', 'Sabre Dance', 'Chrissie Hynde', 'Stop Your Sobbing', 'James Honeyman-Scott', ""Martin Chambers'"", 'Pocket', 'Rock Band']","['NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG']"

""Part 2"", a protest song against rigid schooling, features a children's choir. At the suggestion of producer Bob Ezrin, Pink Floyd added elements of disco.
""Part 2"" was released as a single, Pink Floyd's first in the UK since ""Point Me at the Sky"" (1968). It became their only number-one single in the UK, the United States, West Germany and many other countries, and sold over four million copies worldwide. It was nominated for a Grammy Award, and was number 384 on Rolling Stone's list of ""The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time"". 
The American nu metal band Korn covered all three parts for the 2004 album Greatest Hits, Vol. 1. The first two parts of ""Another Brick in the Wall"" were also covered by the supergroup Class of '99 for the soundtrack of the 1998 film The Faculty; this cover version is notable for being one of Layne Staley's final studio appearances prior to his death in April 2002.In 2019 a remake by Diego Baldenweg with Nora Baldenweg & Lionel Baldenweg was used as the opening theme of the Netflix teenage sci-fi series The Unlisted.","{3842, 4611, 1795, 3459, 7, 2568, 4871, 2955, 524, 2191, 3989, 1432, 1178, 283, 3874, 677, 4134, 1319, 1576, 4007, 5033, 2475, 174, 690, 4020, 4024, 2489, 826, 4920, 703, 4671, 2119, 586, 2507, 2508, 2891, 4430, 463, 4558, 3322, 595, 2388, 4307, 4437, 889, 352, 997, 744, 748, 4589, 1272, 2169, 3578, 3451, 4605}",55,"['Floyd', 'The Wall', 'Floyd', '1979', 'Roger Waters', 'Bob Ezrin', 'Floyd', 'Floyd', 'UK', 'Point Me at the Sky', '1968', 'UK', 'the United States', 'West Germany', 'a Grammy Award', ""Rolling Stone's"", 'The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time', 'American', 'Korn', '2004', 'Greatest Hits', 'Vol', 'Another Brick in the Wall', ""'99"", '1998', 'The Faculty', ""Layne Staley's"", 'April 2002.In 2019', 'Diego Baldenweg', 'Nora Baldenweg & Lionel Baldenweg', 'Netflix']","['PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG']"

367,1980,April,12,US Olympic Committee endorses a boycott of the Moscow Olympic games,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games,"The modern Olympic Games or Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, alternating between the Summer and Winter Games every two years in the four-year period.
Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: Ὀλυμπιακοί Ἀγῶνες), which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.
The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games, and the 2020 Games were postponed to 2021 due to a worldwide coronavirus pandemic that broke out earlier in the year.
The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 14,000 athletes competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2018 Winter Olympics combined, in 35 different sports and over 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.
The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.

371,1980,February,8,Model Angie Bowie (30) divorces singer David Bowie (33) after 9 years of marriage,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie,"David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie ( BOH-ee), was an English singer-songwriter and actor. He was a leading figure in the music industry and is considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. He was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on popular music. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the world's best-selling music artists. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and released eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.
Born in Brixton, South London, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. ""Space Oddity"" became his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single ""Starman"" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as ""plastic soul"", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single ""Fame"" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth, directed by Nicolas Roeg, and released Station to Station. The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the electronic-inflected album Low (1977), the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the ""Berlin Trilogy"". ""Heroes"" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.
After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single ""Ashes to Ashes"", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and ""Under Pressure"", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He reached his commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance; the album's title track topped both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth (1986), Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with The Next Day. He remained musically active until he died of liver cancer at his home in New York City, two days after his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, Blackstar (2016).","{1378, 4741}",2,"['David Bowie', '9 years', 'David Robert Jones', '8 January 1947', '10 January 2016', 'David Bowie', 'English', 'the 20th century', 'the 1970s', 'UK', 'US', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame', '1996', 'Brixton', 'South London', 'Bowie', '1963', 'the UK Singles Chart', 'July 1969', '1972', 'Ziggy Stardust', 'Starman', 'The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust', 'Mars', '1975', 'Bowie', 'UK', 'US', 'Fame', 'Young Americans', '1976', 'Bowie', 'The Man', 'Earth', 'Nicolas Roeg', 'Station to Station', 'The following year', '1977', 'Brian Eno', 'the ""Berlin Trilogy""', 'Heroes', '1977', 'Lodger', '1979', 'UK', 'the late 1970s', 'Bowie', 'UK', '1980', 'Scary Monsters', 'Under Pressure', '1981', '1983', 'UK', 'US', 'the 1990s', '2000s', 'Bowie', 'Jack Celliers', 'Merry Christmas', 'Lawrence', '1983', 'Jareth the Goblin King', 'Labyrinth', '1986', 'Pontius Pilate', 'The Last Temptation of Christ', '1988', 'Nikola Tesla', '2006', '2004', '2006', '2013', 'Bowie', 'The Next Day', 'New York City', 'two days', 'Blackstar', '2016']","['PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'LANGUAGE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE']"

The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation, encouraging peaceful applications in space science. Since its establishment, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches.
NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System; advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program; exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons; and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs.

The U.S. Federal Reserve noted in November 2019 that leveraged loans, corporate bonds made to companies with poor credit histories or large amounts of existing debt, were the fastest growing asset class, increasing in size by 14.6% in 2018 alone. Total U.S. corporate debt in November 2019 reached a record 47% of the entire U.S. economy. However, corporate borrowing expanded worldwide under the low interest rates of the Great Recession. Two-thirds of global growth in corporate debt occurred in developing countries, in particular China. The value of outstanding Chinese non-financial corporate bonds increased from $69 billion in 2007 to $2 trillion in 2017. In December 2019, Moody's Analytics described Chinese corporate debt as the ""biggest threat"" to the global economy.Regulators and investors have raised concern that large amounts of risky corporate debt have created a critical vulnerability for financial markets, in particular mutual funds, during the next recession. Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen has warned that the large amount of corporate debt could ""prolong"" the next recession and cause corporate bankruptcies. The Institute of International Finance forecast that, in an economic downturn half as severe as the 2008 crisis,  $19 trillion in debt would be owed by non-financial firms without the earnings to cover the interest payments, referred to as zombie firms. The McKinsey Global Institute warned in 2018 that the greatest risks would be to emerging markets such as China, India, and Brazil, where 25-30% of bonds had been issued by high-risk companies.

""Hill Street Station"" originally aired in the United States on NBC on Thursday January 15, 1981 at 10:00 PM Eastern time as part of a two-week five-episode limited-run pilot airing on Thursdays and Saturdays. The episode won numerous Primetime Emmy Awards (Directing, Writing, Sound Editing, and Cinematography), a Directors Guild of America Award, a Writers Guild of America Award, and an Edgar Award as well as Emmy Award nominations for film editing, music composition, and art direction. The episode was directed by Robert Butler and written by Michael Kozoll and Steven Bochco.
Unlike other high-profile debuts from the 1980–81 network television season that had two- and three-hour premieres, such as Dynasty and Flamingo Road, this premiere episode debuted by itself as a one-hour offering. That season, even some holdovers, such as B. J. and the Bear and Buck Rogers, had multi-hour season premieres. The main storyline involves a hostage situation that arose from an attempted armed robbery. The episode also introduces a host of unique characters.  At the time of the debut, Robert McLean described the cast as a ""cast of unknowns"".","{2052, 7, 2568, 524, 1576, 4138, 4671, 576, 580, 2647, 3676, 606, 1633, 1133, 3187, 2171, 3722, 663, 1192, 3243, 174, 1711, 176, 690, 3252, 703, 4287, 1730, 1732, 3272, 2767, 4307, 1757, 1251, 2278, 2793, 748, 1260, 1272, 3322, 1288, 3874, 1319, 4400, 826, 3901, 3908, 843, 2379, 2901, 3413, 4437, 4967, 4971, 889, 4990, 3459, 3978, 2955, 1424, 3473, 1938, 5010, 1432, 3999, 4516, 5033, 2487, 2489, 1979, 453, 2508, 4558, 3542, 2525, 990, 1508, 3044, 2026, 1526, 3578, 4605}",82,"['Hill Street Blues', 'NBC', 'Hill Street Station', 'the first season', 'American', 'Hill Street Blues', 'Hill Street Station', 'the United States', 'NBC', 'Thursday January 15, 1981', 'two-week', 'Thursdays', 'Primetime Emmy Awards', 'Cinematography', 'an Edgar Award', 'Emmy Award', 'Robert Butler', 'Michael Kozoll', 'Steven Bochco', 'the 1980–81 network television', 'Dynasty', 'Flamingo Road', 'B.

387,1981,May,11,"Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical ""Cats"" (based on poetry by T. S. Eliot) directed by Trevor Nunn first premieres in the West End, London",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_(musical),"Cats is a sung-through musical composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, based on the 1939 poetry collection Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by T. S. Eliot. It tells the story of a tribe of cats called the Jellicles and the night they make the ""Jellicle choice,"" deciding which cat will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life. The musical includes the well-known song ""Memory"" as sung by Grizabella. As of 2019, Cats remains the fourth-longest-running Broadway show and the sixth-longest-running West End show.
Lloyd Webber began setting Eliot's poems to music in 1977 and the compositions were first presented as a song cycle in 1980. Producer Cameron Mackintosh then recruited director Trevor Nunn and choreographer Gillian Lynne to turn the songs into a complete musical. Cats opened to positive reviews at the New London Theatre in the West End in 1981 and then to mixed reviews at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in 1982. It won numerous awards including Best Musical at both the Laurence Olivier and Tony Awards. Despite its unusual premise that deterred investors initially, the musical turned out to be an unprecedented commercial success, with a worldwide gross of US$3.5 billion by 2012. 
The London production ran for 21 years and 8,949 performances, while the Broadway production ran for 18 years and 7,485 performances, making Cats the longest-running musical in both theatre districts for a number of years. Cats has since been revived in the West End twice and on Broadway once. It has also been translated into multiple languages and performed around the world many times. Long-running foreign productions include a 15-year run at the Operettenhaus in Hamburg that played over 6,100 performances, as well as an ongoing run in a purpose-built theatre in Japan that has played over 10,000 performances since it opened in 1983.
Cats started the megamusical phenomenon, establishing a global market for musical theatre and directing the industry's focus to big-budget blockbusters, as well as family- and tourist-friendly shows. The musical's profound but polarising influence also reshaped the aesthetic, technology, and marketing of the medium. Cats was adapted into a direct-to-video film in 1998, and a critically panned feature film adaptation directed by Tom Hooper in 2019.","{2051, 7, 2568, 3601, 34, 1058, 4642, 4134, 1576, 1584, 3122, 4661, 2104, 2112, 1602, 583, 2119, 595, 1622, 2141, 2152, 1646, 1136, 1649, 2169, 2682, 127, 640, 4235, 1678, 2191, 2703, 3727, 1170, 1177, 4768, 1185, 1706, 3243, 1197, 1709, 4785, 698, 703, 3777, 1739, 3795, 4307, 3803, 4829, 3812, 3813, 3322, 3842, 4871, 272, 2322, 3862, 4895, 290, 2339, 1832, 4905, 2875, 4923, 4413, 2891, 4430, 2388, 3413, 3927, 4445, 1888, 1890, 4971, 1908, 889, 3451, 892, 4993, 4994, 387, 900, 3978, 2955, 3979, 3989, 4526, 2483, 4024, 1465, 4536, 452, 964, 3524, 4549, 2507, 2000, 4051, 2004, 5077, 4074, 4589, 2039, 3578, 4605}",106,"[""Andrew Lloyd Webber's"", 'Cats', 'T.

He then became one of the most successful sires of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, The Blood-Horse ranked him as one of the top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century. As a sire of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.
At age two, Northern Dancer was named the Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt after winning both the Summer Stakes and Coronation Futurity in Canada, plus the Remsen Stakes in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the Flamingo Stakes, Florida Derby, and Blue Grass Stakes. Northern Dancer followed up a narrow victory in the Kentucky Derby by winning the Preakness Stakes. With a chance at the American Triple Crown, he finished third in the Belmont Stakes. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the Queen's Plate in what proved to be his last race.
Northern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at Windfields Farm in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by English Triple Crown winner Nijinsky, brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.","{4224, 4736, 3842, 1539, 1668, 1795, 2051, 7, 2568, 4611, 1802, 2955, 4235, 2702, 656, 1938, 403, 3989, 1432, 1177, 1052, 2721, 418, 290, 36, 2210, 4134, 4007, 1576, 4642, 2171, 4400, 2483, 694, 1847, 4920, 826, 699, 4413, 1985, 3524, 1990, 967, 4426, 2507, 4815, 4688, 5074, 595, 4307, 2141, 889, 607, 5088, 2018, 997, 3686, 1640, 4971, 748, 3180, 4589, 3954, 1395, 1780, 2169, 3322, 3451, 4990, 3199}",70,"['Bill Shoemaker', '2000', 'Northern Dancer', 'May 27, 1961', 'November 16, 1990', 'Thoroughbred', '1964', 'Canadian', 'Kentucky', 'the 20th century', 'Canadian', 'the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame', '1965', 'the Racing Hall of Fame', 'Canada', 'the United States', '1976', 'U.S. Thoroughbred', 'the 20th century', 'age two', 'Northern Dancer', 'Canadian', 'Two-Year-Old', 'Canada', 'the Remsen Stakes', 'New York', 'Kentucky', 'Flamingo Stakes', 'Florida Derby', 'Blue Grass Stakes', 'Kentucky', 'the Preakness Stakes', 'the American Triple Crown', 'the Belmont Stakes', 'Canada', ""the Queen's Plate"", 'Northern Dancer', '1965', 'Windfields Farm', 'Canada', '1968', 'English', 'Nijinsky', 'Maryland', 'Windfields Farm']","['PERSON', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG']"
390,1981,December,27,Oiler Wayne Gretzky becomes fastest NHLer to get 100 pts (38th game),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarom%C3%ADr_J%C3%A1gr,"Jaromír Jágr (Czech pronunciation: [ˈjaromiːr ˈjaːɡr̩] (listen); born 15 February 1972) is a Czech professional ice hockey right winger for HC Kladno of the Czech Extraliga (ELH). He has previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Pittsburgh Penguins, Washington Capitals, New York Rangers, Philadelphia Flyers, Dallas Stars, Boston Bruins, New Jersey Devils, Florida Panthers and Calgary Flames, serving as captain of the Penguins and the Rangers.

He returned to the NHL in 2011 with the Flyers and remained in the league for seven more years before being assigned by the Flames in 2018 to HC Kladno, which he owns.
Jágr has the second-most points in NHL history, after Wayne Gretzky. He is the most productive European player who has ever played in the NHL and is considered one of the greatest professional hockey players of all time. In 1990, at age 18, he was the youngest player in the NHL. Until his transfer, at age 45, he was the oldest player in the NHL, and is the oldest player to record a hat-trick. In 2017, Jágr was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history.Jágr was the fifth overall selection in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. He won consecutive Stanley Cups in the 1991 and 1992 seasons with the Penguins. Individually, he has won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL scoring champion five times (four times in a row), the Lester B. Pearson Award for the NHL's outstanding player as voted by the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) three times and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player once, while finishing second four times.

394,1981,January,10,Singer James Brown (47) divorces Deidre Jenkins after 10 years of marriage,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown,"James Joseph Brown (May 3, 1933 – December 25, 2006) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, musician, record producer and bandleader. A progenitor of funk music and a major figure of 20th century music and dance, he is often referred to as the ""Godfather of Soul"" and ""Soul Brother No. 1"". In a career that lasted over 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres.Brown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He joined a rhythm and blues vocal group, the Gospel Starlighters (which later evolved into the Famous Flames) founded by Bobby Byrd, in which he was the lead singer. First coming to national public attention in the late 1950s as a member of the singing group The Famous Flames with the hit ballads ""Please, Please, Please"" and ""Try Me"", Brown built a reputation as a tireless live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album Live at the Apollo and hit singles such as ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"", ""I Got You (I Feel Good)"" and ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World"".
During the late 1960s, Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly ""Africanized"" approach to music-making that influenced the development of funk music. By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation of the J.B.s with records such as ""Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine"" and ""The Payback"". He also became noted for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit ""Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud"". Brown continued to perform and record until his death from pneumonia in 2006. 
Brown recorded 17 singles that reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B charts. He also holds the record for the most singles listed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart which did not reach No. 1. Brown was inducted into 1st class of the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013 as an artist and then in 2017 as a songwriter. He also received honors from many other institutions, including inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. In Joel Whitburn's analysis of the Billboard R&B charts from 1942 to 2010, Brown is ranked No. 1 in The Top 500 Artists. He is ranked No. 7 on Rolling Stone's list of its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Rolling Stone has also cited Brown as the most sampled artist of all time.",{4224},1,"['James Brown', 'Deidre Jenkins', '10 years', 'James Joseph Brown', 'May 3, 1933 – December 25, 2006', 'American', '20th century', 'Godfather of Soul', 'Soul Brother', '50 years', 'Brown', 'Toccoa', 'Georgia', 'the Gospel Starlighters', 'the Famous Flames', 'Bobby Byrd', 'the late 1950s', 'The Famous Flames', 'Please, Please, Please', 'Try Me', 'Brown', 'the James Brown Band', 'James Brown Orchestra', 'the 1960s', 'Apollo', ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"", 'I Got You', 'the late 1960s', 'Brown', 'Africanized', 'the early 1970s', 'Brown', 'Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine', 'The Payback', '1968', 'Say It Loud', 'Brown', '2006', 'Brown', 'Billboard R&B', 'Billboard Hot 100', 'Brown', 'the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame', '2013', '2017', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame', ""Joel Whitburn's"", 'Billboard R&B', '1942 to 2010', 'Brown', ""Rolling Stone's"", 'Rolling Stone', 'Brown']","['PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON']"

The British claim to sovereignty dates from 1690, and the United Kingdom has exercised de facto sovereignty over the archipelago almost continuously since 1833. The first recorded landing was made by an Englishman, Captain John Strong, in 1690. Argentina has long disputed this claim, having been in control of the islands for a few years prior to 1833. The dispute escalated in 1982, when Argentina invaded the islands, precipitating the Falklands War.

397,1982,May,2,"Falklands War: Argentine cruiser General Belgrano sunk by British submarine Conqueror, killing more than 350 men",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War,"The Falklands War (Spanish: Guerra de las Malvinas) was a 10-week undeclared war between Argentina and the United Kingdom in 1982 over two British dependent territories in the South Atlantic: the Falkland Islands and its territorial dependency, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.
The conflict began on 2 April, when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands, followed by the invasion of South Georgia the next day. On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14 June, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders died during the hostilities.
The conflict was a major episode in the protracted dispute over the territories' sovereignty. Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands are Argentine territory, and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a Crown colony since 1841. Falkland Islanders, who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th century, are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly favour British sovereignty. Neither state officially declared war, although both governments declared the Islands a war zone. 
The conflict has had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various books, articles, films, and songs. Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the outcome prompted large protests against the ruling military government, hastening its downfall and the democratization of the country. In the United Kingdom, the Conservative government, bolstered by the successful outcome, was re-elected with an increased majority the following year. The cultural and political effect of the conflict has been less in the UK than in Argentina, where it remains a common topic for discussion.Diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in Madrid, at which the two governments issued a joint statement. No change in either country's position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit. In 1994, Argentina's claim to the territories was added to its constitution.","{4871, 264, 1288, 3722, 2955, 3979, 1424, 3473, 4498, 663, 152, 2722, 4516, 3365, 4138, 3243, 4526, 303, 1583, 177, 2483, 3252, 4661, 2487, 1979, 3519, 4287, 1730, 452, 580, 3524, 3272, 843, 2767, 2901, 982, 2647, 3413, 3676, 1757, 1374, 990, 1633, 1251, 996, 2278, 2793, 2026, 3436, 4845, 3578, 2171, 4605}",53,"['Argentine', 'Belgrano', 'British', 'Conqueror', 'The Falklands War', 'Spanish', 'Guerra de las Malvinas', 'Argentina', 'the United Kingdom', '1982', 'British', 'the South Atlantic', 'the Falkland Islands', 'South Georgia', 'the South Sandwich Islands', '2 April', 'Argentina', 'the Falkland Islands', 'South Georgia', 'the next day', '5 April', 'British', 'the Argentine Navy', 'Air Force', '74 days', 'Argentine', '14 June', 'British', 'Argentine', 'British', 'Falkland Islanders', 'Argentina', 'Argentine', 'Argentine', 'British', 'Crown', '1841', 'Falkland Islanders', 'the early 19th century', 'British', 'British', 'Argentina', 'the United Kingdom', 'Conservative', 'the following year', 'UK', 'Argentina', 'the United Kingdom', 'Argentina', '1989', 'Madrid', 'the Falkland Islands', '1994', 'Argentina']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE']"
398,1982,June,6,"30,000 Israeli troops invade Lebanon to drive out the PLO",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Lebanon_War,"The 1982 Lebanon War, dubbed Operation Peace for Galilee (Hebrew: מבצע שלום הגליל, or מבצע של""ג‎ Mivtsa Shlom HaGalil or Mivtsa Sheleg) by the Israeli government, later known in Israel as the Lebanon War or the First Lebanon War (Hebrew: מלחמת לבנון הראשונה‎, Milhemet Levanon Harishona), and known in Lebanon as ""the invasion"" (Arabic: الاجتياح‎, Al-ijtiyāḥ), began on 6 June 1982, when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) invaded southern Lebanon, after repeated attacks and counter-attacks between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) operating in southern Lebanon and the IDF that had caused civilian casualties on both sides of the border. The military operation was launched after gunmen from Abu Nidal's organization attempted to assassinate Shlomo Argov, Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin blamed Abu Nidal's enemy, the PLO, for the incident, and used the incident as a casus belli for the invasion.After attacking the PLO – as well as Syrian, leftist, and Muslim Lebanese forces – the Israeli military, in cooperation with their Maronite allies and the self-styled Free Lebanon State, occupied southern Lebanon, eventually surrounding the PLO and elements of the Syrian Army. Surrounded in West Beirut and subjected to heavy bombardment, the PLO forces and their allies negotiated passage from Lebanon with the aid of United States Special Envoy Philip Habib and the protection of international peacekeepers. The PLO, under the chairmanship of Yasser Arafat, had relocated its headquarters to Tripoli in June 1982. By expelling the PLO, removing Syrian influence over Lebanon, and installing a pro-Israeli Christian government led by President Bachir Gemayel, Israel hoped to sign a treaty which Menachem Begin promised would give Israel ""forty years of peace"".Following the assassination of Gemayel in September 1982, Israel's position in Beirut became untenable and the signing of a peace treaty became increasingly unlikely. Outrage following the IDF's role in the Phalangist-perpetrated Sabra and Shatila massacre of Palestinians and Lebanese Shias, as well as Israeli popular disillusionment with the war, led to a gradual withdrawal from Beirut to the areas claimed by the Free Lebanon State in southern Lebanon (later to become the South Lebanon security belt), which was initiated following the 17 May Agreement and Syria's change of attitude towards the PLO. After Israeli forces withdrew from most of Lebanon, the War of the Camps broke out between Lebanese factions, the remains of the PLO and Syria, in which Syria fought its former Palestinian allies. At the same time, Shi'a militant groups began consolidating and waging a low-intensity guerrilla war over the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, leading to 15 years of low-scale armed conflict. The Lebanese Civil War would continue until 1990, at which point Syria had established complete dominance over Lebanon.","{1026, 2051, 7, 2568, 3613, 4134, 1584, 2104, 2119, 4682, 3154, 595, 1622, 3671, 2141, 2150, 2152, 620, 1646, 1136, 1649, 3190, 2169, 2682, 2684, 127, 128, 640, 1678, 2191, 2703, 3727, 4758, 1177, 4768, 1706, 4785, 1739, 1228, 4307, 3795, 3803, 4829, 3812, 3813, 3322, 3842, 4879, 2322, 3862, 2332, 4895, 290, 815, 4940, 4430, 2388, 2391, 4445, 1888, 1890, 358, 873, 1388, 889, 890, 3451, 4993, 3970, 387, 4994, 903, 2955, 3979, 3989, 1944, 2483, 3508, 4024, 4539, 452, 3524, 4549, 2507, 467, 2004, 4051, 5077, 1502, 2529, 4589, 3061, 3574, 4605}",94,"['Israeli', 'Lebanon', 'PLO', '1982', 'Lebanon War', 'Operation Peace for Galilee', 'Hebrew', 'Mivtsa Shlom HaGalil', 'Mivtsa Sheleg', 'Israeli', 'Israel', 'the Lebanon War', 'the First Lebanon War', 'Hebrew', 'לבנון הראשונה\u200e', 'Milhemet Levanon Harishona', 'Lebanon', 'Arabic', 'Al-ijtiyāḥ', '6 June 1982', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Lebanon', 'the Palestine Liberation Organization', 'PLO', 'Lebanon', 'IDF', ""Abu Nidal's"", 'Shlomo Argov', 'Israel', 'the United Kingdom', 'Israeli', 'Menachem Begin', ""Abu Nidal's"", 'PLO', 'PLO', 'Syrian', 'Muslim', 'Lebanese', 'Israeli', 'Maronite', 'Lebanon State', 'Lebanon', 'PLO', 'the Syrian Army', 'West Beirut', 'PLO', 'Lebanon', 'United States Special Envoy', 'Philip Habib', 'PLO', 'Yasser Arafat', 'Tripoli', 'June 1982', 'PLO', 'Syrian', 'Lebanon', 'Christian', 'Bachir Gemayel', 'Israel', 'Menachem Begin', 'Israel', 'forty years', 'Gemayel', 'September 1982', 'Israel', 'Beirut', 'IDF', 'Phalangist', 'Sabra', 'Shatila', 'Palestinians', 'Lebanese', 'Shias', 'Israeli', 'Beirut', 'Lebanon', 'South Lebanon', 'Syria', 'PLO', 'Israeli', 'Lebanon', 'the War of the Camps', 'Lebanese', 'PLO', 'Syria', 'Syria', 'Palestinian', 'Israeli', 'Lebanon', '15 years', 'The Lebanese Civil War', '1990', 'Syria', 'Lebanon']","['NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'LANGUAGE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE']"
399,1982,June,14,"Argentina surrenders to Great Britain, ending the 74-day Falklands Islands conflict",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War,"The Falklands War (Spanish: Guerra de las Malvinas) was a 10-week undeclared war between Argentina and the United Kingdom in 1982 over two British dependent territories in the South Atlantic: the Falkland Islands and its territorial dependency, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.
The conflict began on 2 April, when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands, followed by the invasion of South Georgia the next day. On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14 June, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders died during the hostilities.
The conflict was a major episode in the protracted dispute over the territories' sovereignty. Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands are Argentine territory, and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a Crown colony since 1841. Falkland Islanders, who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th century, are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly favour British sovereignty. Neither state officially declared war, although both governments declared the Islands a war zone. 
The conflict has had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various books, articles, films, and songs. Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the outcome prompted large protests against the ruling military government, hastening its downfall and the democratization of the country. In the United Kingdom, the Conservative government, bolstered by the successful outcome, was re-elected with an increased majority the following year. The cultural and political effect of the conflict has been less in the UK than in Argentina, where it remains a common topic for discussion.Diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in Madrid, at which the two governments issued a joint statement. No change in either country's position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit. In 1994, Argentina's claim to the territories was added to its constitution.",set(),0,"['Argentina', 'Great Britain', 'Falklands Islands', 'The Falklands War', 'Spanish', 'Guerra de las Malvinas', 'Argentina', 'the United Kingdom', '1982', 'British', 'the South Atlantic', 'the Falkland Islands', 'South Georgia', 'the South Sandwich Islands', '2 April', 'Argentina', 'the Falkland Islands', 'South Georgia', 'the next day', '5 April', 'British', 'the Argentine Navy', 'Air Force', '74 days', 'Argentine', '14 June', 'British', 'Argentine', 'British', 'Falkland Islanders', 'Argentina', 'Argentine', 'Argentine', 'British', 'Crown', '1841', 'Falkland Islanders', 'the early 19th century', 'British', 'British', 'Argentina', 'the United Kingdom', 'Conservative', 'the following year', 'UK', 'Argentina', 'the United Kingdom', 'Argentina', '1989', 'Madrid', 'the Falkland Islands', '1994', 'Argentina']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE']"
400,1982,October,14,US President Reagan proclaims a war on drugs,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan,"Ronald Wilson Reagan (; February 6, 1911 – June 5, 2004) was an American politician who served as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989 and became a highly influential voice of modern conservatism. Prior to his presidency, he was a Hollywood actor and union leader before serving as the 33rd governor of California from 1967 to 1975.
Reagan was raised in a low-income family in small towns of northern Illinois. He graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and worked as a sports commentator on several regional radio stations. After moving to California in 1937, he found work as an actor and starred in a few major productions. Reagan was twice elected president of the Screen Actors Guild—the labor union for actors—where he worked to root out communist influence. In the 1950s, he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at General Electric factories, during which time he became a conservative. Reagan was a Democrat until 1962 when he switched to the Republican Party. In 1964, Reagan's speech ""A Time for Choosing"" supported Barry Goldwater's foundering presidential campaign and earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman. Building a network of supporters, Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966. As governor, Reagan raised taxes, turned a state budget deficit to a surplus, challenged the protesters at the University of California, ordered in National Guard troops during a period of protest movements in 1969, and was re-elected in 1970. He twice ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination, in 1968 and 1976.
In 1980, Reagan won the Republican presidential nomination and defeated the incumbent president, Jimmy Carter. At 69 years, 349 days of age at the time of his first inauguration, Reagan was the oldest person to assume the U.S. presidency, a distinction he held until 2017, when Donald Trump was inaugurated at age 70 years, 220 days. Reagan faced former vice president Walter Mondale when he ran for re-election in 1984 and defeated him, winning the most electoral votes of any U.S. president, 525, or 97.6% of the 538 votes in the Electoral College. It was the second-most lopsided presidential election in modern U.S. history after Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1936 victory over Alfred M. Landon, in which he won 98.5%, or 523, of the (then-total) 531 electoral votes.Soon after taking office as president, Reagan began implementing sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His supply-side economic policies, dubbed ""Reaganomics"", advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term, he survived an assassination attempt, spurred the War on Drugs, invaded Grenada, and fought public sector labor unions. Over his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4% and an average real GDP annual growth of 3.4%. Reagan enacted cuts in domestic discretionary spending, cut taxes, and increased military spending, which contributed to increased federal debt overall. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including the bombing of Libya, the Iran–Iraq War, the Iran–Contra affair, and the ongoing Cold War. In June 1987, four years after he publicly described the Soviet Union as an ""evil empire"", Reagan challenged Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to ""tear down this wall!"", during a speech at the Brandenburg Gate. He transitioned Cold War policy from détente to rollback by escalating an arms race with the USSR while engaging in talks with Gorbachev. The talks culminated in the INF Treaty, which shrank both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan began his presidency during the decline of the Soviet Union, which ultimately collapsed nearly three years after he left office.
When Reagan left office in 1989, he held an approval rating of 68%, matching those of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and later Bill Clinton, as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era. He was the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve two full terms after the five prior presidents did not. Although he had planned an active post-presidency, Reagan disclosed in November 1994 that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier that year. Afterward, his informal public appearances became more infrequent as the disease progressed. He died at home on June 5, 2004. His tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States, and he is an icon among conservatives. Evaluations of his presidency among historians and the general public place him among the upper tier of American presidents.","{4992, 771, 3722, 3083, 1292, 144, 1170, 4115, 5010, 663, 154, 1058, 4899, 3621, 39, 424, 551, 1192, 2601, 4140, 4649, 4526, 1455, 1584, 4785, 565, 4661, 2487, 2104, 2489, 1341, 3005, 703, 576, 1857, 2241, 3139, 452, 3777, 3903, 4287, 5059, 843, 1742, 463, 2767, 4558, 4437, 2647, 5079, 3676, 4829, 990, 478, 3934, 4192, 3813, 2152, 1386, 632, 3054, 1905, 3061, 1272, 3578, 4605}",66,"['US', 'Reagan', 'Ronald Wilson Reagan', 'February 6, 1911', 'June 5, 2004', 'American', 'the United States', '1981 to 1989', 'Hollywood', 'California', '1967 to 1975', 'Reagan', 'Illinois', 'Eureka College', '1932', 'California', '1937', 'Reagan', 'the Screen Actors Guild', 'the 1950s', 'General Electric', 'Reagan', 'Democrat', '1962', 'the Republican Party', '1964', 'Reagan', 'A Time for Choosing', ""Barry Goldwater's"", 'Reagan', 'California', '1966', 'Reagan', 'the University of California', 'National Guard', '1969', '1970', 'Republican', '1968', '1976', '1980', 'Reagan', 'Republican', 'Jimmy Carter', '69 years', '349 days of age', 'Reagan', 'U.S.', '2017', 'Donald Trump', 'age 70 years', '220 days', 'Reagan', 'Walter Mondale', '1984', 'U.S.', '97.6%', 'the Electoral College', 'U.S.', ""Franklin D.

401,1982,October,27,China announces its population has reached 1 billion plus people,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China,"China (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó; literally: 'Central State'), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC; Chinese: 中华人民共和国; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó), is a country in East Asia. It is the world's most populous country, with a population of around 1.428 billion in 2017. Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the world's third or fourth largest  country by area. Governed by the Communist Party of China, the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.
China emerged as one of the world's first civilizations, in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE. Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire. The succeeding Han dynasty, which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass, along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Northern Song (960–1127) completed the Four Great Inventions. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa. Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution, when the Republic of China (ROC) replaced the Qing dynasty. China, as a whole, was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II. The subsequent Chinese Civil War resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China on mainland China while the Kuomintang-led nationalist government retreated to the island of Taiwan where it governed until 1996 when Taiwan transitioned to democracy. The political status of Taiwan remains disputed to this day.
China is a unitary one-party socialist republic and is one of the few existing socialist states. Political dissidents and human rights groups have denounced and criticized the Chinese government for human rights abuses, suppression of religious and ethnic minorities, censorship and mass surveillance, and cracking down on protests such as in 1989. The Chinese government says that the right to subsistence and economic development is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present economic level.
Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China's economy has been one of the world's fastest-growing with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017. According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion Yuan ($13.5 trillion). Since 2010, China has been the world's second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and since 2014, the largest economy in the world by PPP. China is also the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods. China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army, the People's Liberation Army, and the second-largest defense budget. The PRC is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council as it replaced the ROC in 1971, as well as an active global partner of ASEAN Plus mechanism. China has been characterized as a potential superpower, mainly because of its massive population, large and rapidly-growing economy, and powerful military.","{260, 580, 4516, 3399, 663, 942, 145, 4157, 661, 2205, 2487, 920, 793, 2717, 4287}",15,"['China', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Zhōngguó', ""the People's Republic of China"", 'PRC', 'Chinese', 'Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó', 'East Asia', '2017', 'the Communist Party of China', 'Beijing', 'Tianjin', 'Shanghai', 'Chongqing', 'Hong Kong', 'Macau', 'China', 'the Yellow River', 'the North China Plain', 'China', '21st century', 'China', 'the 3rd century', 'Qin', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Han dynasty', 'the Tang dynasty', 'the Four Great Inventions', 'Tang', 'Asia', 'Silk Route', 'Mesopotamia', 'the Horn of Africa', '1912', 'the Xinhai Revolution', 'the Republic of China', 'ROC', 'the Qing dynasty', 'China', 'Japan', 'World War II', 'Chinese Civil War', '1949', 'the Communist Party of China', 'Mao Zedong', ""the People's Republic of China"", 'China', 'Kuomintang', 'Taiwan', '1996', 'Taiwan', 'Taiwan', 'this day', 'China', 'Chinese', '1989', 'Chinese', '1978', 'China', 'above 6 percent', 'the World Bank', 'China', '1978', '2017', 'China', '2018', '2010', 'China', '2014', 'PPP', 'China', 'China', ""the People's Liberation Army"", 'PRC', 'the United Nations Security Council', 'ROC', '1971', 'ASEAN', 'China']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'FAC', 'PRODUCT', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERCENT', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE']"
402,1982,November,30,"""Gandhi"" directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Ben Kingsley and John Gielgud premieres in New Delhi (Best Picture 1983)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhi_(film),"Gandhi is a 1982 epic historical drama film based on the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the leader of India's non-violent, non-cooperative independence movement against the United Kingdom's rule of the country during the 20th century. The film, a British-Indian co-production, was written by John Briley and produced and directed by Richard Attenborough. It stars Ben Kingsley in the title role.
The film covers Gandhi's life from a defining moment in 1893, as he is thrown off a South African train for being in a whites-only compartment, and concludes with his assassination and funeral in 1948. Although a practising Hindu, Gandhi's embracing of other faiths, particularly Christianity and Islam, is also depicted.
Gandhi was released in India on 30 November 1982, in the United Kingdom on 3 December, and in the United States on 10 December. It was nominated for Academy Awards in eleven categories, winning eight, including Best Picture and Best Director for Attenborough, Best Actor for Ben Kingsley, and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Briley. The film was screened retrospectively on 12 August 2016 as the opening film at the Independence Day Film Festival jointly presented by the Indian Directorate of Film Festivals and Ministry of Defence, commemorating the 70th Indian Independence Day. The screenplay of Gandhi is available as a published book.","{1566, 1058, 4140, 1583, 1584, 561, 565, 1591, 2104, 4671, 4682, 2647, 608, 1633, 2152, 625, 1649, 3186, 3190, 3195, 635, 2171, 640, 1153, 4235, 2703, 144, 1168, 3727, 663, 160, 2721, 2210, 4768, 1192, 4785, 703, 4287, 3777, 3268, 3795, 4307, 4829, 3298, 1251, 3814, 2793, 4330, 4845, 3834, 4871, 1288, 4879, 4895, 4899, 3365, 1319, 4905, 311, 2875, 4413, 4940, 2388, 2901, 2391, 4971, 2415, 370, 4472, 4474, 890, 4993, 3970, 4994, 2955, 3989, 1944, 4516, 2982, 4536, 4539, 452, 964, 4549, 971, 1483, 1997, 4563, 2004, 5077, 3034, 1502, 1508, 3046, 2026, 4589, 1526, 2040, 3578, 4605}",100,"['Gandhi', 'Richard Attenborough', 'Ben Kingsley', 'John Gielgud', 'New Delhi', '1983', 'Gandhi', '1982', 'Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi', 'India', ""the United Kingdom's"", 'the 20th century', 'British', 'John Briley', 'Richard Attenborough', 'Ben Kingsley', 'Gandhi', '1893', 'South African', '1948', 'Hindu', 'Gandhi', 'Christianity', 'Islam', 'Gandhi', 'India', '30 November 1982', 'the United Kingdom', '3 December', 'the United States', '10 December', 'Academy Awards', 'Ben Kingsley', '12 August 2016', 'the Independence Day Film Festival', 'the Indian Directorate of Film Festivals and Ministry of Defence', 'Indian Independence Day', 'Gandhi']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'PERSON']"

A 57-day-long players' strike reduced the 1982 season from a 16-game schedule per team to an abbreviated nine game schedule. Because of the shortened season, the NFL adopted a special 16-team playoff tournament; division standings were ignored for seeding (although each division sent at least one team to the playoffs and each division except the NFC West sent at least two teams). Eight teams from each conference were seeded 1–8 based on their regular season records. Two teams qualified for the playoffs despite losing records (the Cleveland Browns and the Detroit Lions). The season ended with Super Bowl XVII when the Washington Redskins defeated the Miami Dolphins 27-17 at the Rose Bowl.
Before the season, a verdict was handed down against the league in the trial brought by the Oakland Raiders and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum back in 1980. The jury ruled that the NFL violated antitrust laws when it declined to approve the proposed move by the team from Oakland to Los Angeles. Thus, the league was forced to let the officially renamed Los Angeles Raiders play in the second largest city in the United States, returning football to the Los Angeles area proper following a two-year absence (the Los Angeles Rams left the Coliseum for Anaheim Stadium in Orange County in 1980).

His international playing career came to an end when he was found to be involved in a match-fixing scandal in 2000 and subsequently banned by the BCCI for life. In 2012, the Andhra Pradesh High Court declared the life ban illegal. A division bench of the high court set aside the order of the City Civil Court, which had upheld the ban after Azharuddin had challenged it. But by then he was 49 years old and too old to get back on the pitch. He said he was happy the issue was over and done with, and he would not be taking any further legal action: ""It was a long drawn out legal case and it was painful. We fought in the court for 11 years. Finally the verdict has come and I am happy that the ban has been lifted by the court.”

417,1983,January,1,PGA inaugurates all-exempt tour,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament,"The Masters Tournament (usually referred to as simply The Masters, or the U.S. Masters outside of North America) is one of the four major championships in professional golf. Scheduled for the first full week of April, the Masters is the first major of the year, and unlike the others, it is always held at the same location, Augusta National Golf Club, a private course in the southeastern United States, in the city of Augusta, Georgia.
The Masters was started by amateur champion Bobby Jones and investment banker Clifford Roberts. After his grand slam in 1930, Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co-designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie. First played 86 years ago in 1934, the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.
The tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.
Nicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Tiger Woods has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson.

419,1983,January,1,"TCP/IP protocols become the only approved protocol on the ARPANET, replacing the earlier NCP protocol",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET,"The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first wide-area packet-switching network with distributed control and the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. The ARPANET was established by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.Building on the ideas of J. C. R. Licklider, Bob Taylor initiated the ARPANET project in 1966 and appointed Larry Roberts as program manager. Roberts made the key decisions about the network design. He incorporated Donald Davies’ concepts and designs for packet switching, and sought input from Paul Baran. ARPA awarded the contract to build the network to Bolt Beranek & Newman who developed the first protocol for the network. Roberts engaged Leonard Kleinrock to develop mathematical methods for analyzing the packet network technology.The first computers were connected in 1969 and the Network Control Program was implemented in 1970. The network expanded rapidly and was declared operational in 1975 when control passed to the Defense Communications Agency.
Internetworking research in the early 1970s by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf led to the formulation of the Transmission Control Program (TCP) in 1974, which incorporated concepts from the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin. As this work progressed, a protocol was developed by which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks. Originally referred to as IP/TCP, version 4 of TCP/IP was installed in the ARPANET for production use in January 1983 after the Department of Defense made it standard for all military computer networking.Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981, when the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the Computer Science Network (CSNET). In the early 1980s, the NSF funded the establishment of national supercomputing centers at several universities, and provided network access and network interconnectivity with the NSFNET project in 1986. The ARPANET project was formally decommissioned in 1990, after partnerships with the telecommunication and computer industry paved the way for future commercialization of a new world-wide network, known as the Internet.",{4741},1,"['TCP/IP', 'ARPANET', 'NCP', 'The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network', 'ARPANET', 'TCP', 'ARPANET', 'the Advanced Research Projects Agency', 'the United States Department of Defense', 'J.

Written by Sting, the single was the biggest US and UK hit of 1983, topping the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for eight weeks (the band's only No. 1 hit on that chart), and the UK Singles Chart for four weeks. It also topped the Billboard Top Tracks chart for nine weeks.
At the 26th Annual Grammy Awards the song was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, and Record of the Year, winning in the first two categories. For the song, Sting received the 1983 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.The song is considered to be both the Police's and Sting's signature song, and in 2010 was estimated to generate between a quarter and a third of Sting's music publishing income. In the 1983 Rolling Stone critics' and readers' poll, it was voted ""Song of the Year"". In the US, it was the best-selling single of 1983 and fifth-best-selling single of the decade. Billboard ranked it as the No. 1 song for 1983.In May 2019, ""Every Breath You Take"" was recognised by BMI as being the most played song in radio history. With nearly 15 million radio plays, Sting received a BMI Award at a ceremony held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills to mark it being the Most Performed Song in BMI's catalogue, a distinction previously held since 1999 by Mann and Weill's ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"". BMI President and CEO Mike O'Neill stated: ""For the first time in 22 years, BMI has a new top song in our repertoire with Sting's timeless hit 'Every Breath You Take,' a remarkable achievement that solidifies its place in songwriting history.""The song ranked No. 84 on the Rolling Stone list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and is included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. It also ranked number 25 on Billboard's Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs. In 2008, Q magazine named it among the top 10 British Songs of the 1980s.

431,1983,November,2,"""Thriller"" single released worldwide by Michael Jackson",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(album),"Thriller is the sixth studio album by American singer Michael Jackson, released on November 30, 1982 by Epic Records. Reunited with Off the Wall producer Quincy Jones, Jackson was inspired to create an album where ""every song was a killer"". With the ongoing backlash against disco, Jackson moved in a new musical direction, incorporating pop, post-disco, R&B, rock and funk. Thriller features a single guest appearance, with Paul McCartney becoming the first artist to be featured on Jackson's albums. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, with a production budget of $750,000.
Thriller became Jackson's first number one album on the Billboard 200. It produced seven singles: ""The Girl Is Mine"", ""Billie Jean"", ""Beat It"", ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' "", ""Human Nature"", ""P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)"", and ""Thriller"". All the singles reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, setting the record for the most top 10 singles from an album, with ""Beat It"" and ""Billie Jean"" reaching number one on the chart. Following Jackson's performance of ""Billie Jean"" at Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, where he debuted his signature moonwalk dance, the sales of the album significantly increased, selling one million copies worldwide per week. Michael Jackson's Thriller, the ""Thriller"" music video, was premiered to great anticipation in December 1983 and played regularly on MTV, which also increased the sales of the album. By the end of 1983, Thriller became the best-selling album of all time, having sold 32 million copies. It was the best-selling album worldwide of 1983 and 1984, and was also the best-selling album in the United States in 1983 and 1984, making it the first album to be the country's best-selling for two years. It spent a record 37 weeks at number one on the Billboard 200, from February 26, 1983 to April 14, 1984, and has spent 400 weeks on the chart and counting.
Thriller's success set the standard for the music industry with its songs, music videos and promotion strategies influencing artists, record labels, producers, marketers and choreographers. In 1984, a pop art of Jackson designed by Andy Warhol was featured on the cover of Time who acclaimed the impact of the album, writing, ""The pulse of America and much of the rest of the world moves irregularly, beating in time to the tough strut of 'Billie Jean', the asphalt aria of 'Beat It', the supremely cool chills of 'Thriller'."" The album broke racial barriers in popular music, enabling Jackson's appearances on MTV and meeting with President Ronald Reagan at the White House. It was one of the first to use music videos as successful promotional tools, and the videos for the songs ""Billie Jean"" and ""Beat It"" and the short film Michael Jackson's Thriller all received regular rotation on MTV and are credited for transforming music videos into a serious art form, with the latter also popularizing short films in the music industry.
Thriller remains the best-selling album of all time, with sales of 66 million copies worldwide. It is the second-best-selling album in the United States and was the first to reach 30× Platinum or 3× Diamond. As of February 2017, it has sold 33 million certified album-equivalent units in the US. It won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards at the 26th Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year whilst ""Beat It"" won Record of the Year. Viewed by critics and publications as one of the greatest albums of all time, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry of ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant recordings"", and Michael Jackson's Thriller was inducted into the National Film Preservation Board's National Film Registry of ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant films"". Regarding the importance of Thriller, Rolling Stone wrote; ""It's hard to imagine the present-day musical landscape without Thriller, which changed the game both sonically and marketwise.""","{1378, 4741}",2,"['Thriller', 'Michael Jackson', 'Thriller', 'American', 'Michael Jackson', 'November 30, 1982', 'Epic Records', 'Wall', 'Quincy Jones', 'Jackson', 'Jackson', 'R&B', 'Thriller', 'Paul McCartney', 'Jackson', 'April to November 1982', 'Westlake Recording Studios', 'Los Angeles', 'Thriller', 'Jackson', 'The Girl Is Mine', 'Billie Jean', ""Wanna Be Startin'"", 'Human Nature', 'P.Y.T.', 'Thriller', 'Billboard Hot 100', 'Billie Jean', 'Jackson', 'Billie Jean', 'Yesterday, Today', 'Forever', ""Michael Jackson's"", 'Thriller', 'Thriller', 'December 1983', 'MTV', 'the end of 1983', 'Thriller', '1983', '1984', 'the United States', '1983', '1984', 'two years', '37 weeks', 'February 26, 1983 to', 'April 14, 1984', '400 weeks', 'Thriller', '1984', 'Jackson', 'Andy Warhol', 'Time', 'The pulse of America', ""'Billie Jean'"", ""'Beat It'"", 'Thriller', 'Jackson', 'MTV', 'Ronald Reagan', 'the White House', 'Billie Jean', 'Beat It', ""Michael Jackson's"", 'MTV', 'Thriller', 'the United States', '30× Platinum', 'Diamond', 'February 2017', 'US', 'Grammy Awards', 'Grammy Awards', 'Album of the Year', 'the Year', 'the Grammy Hall of Fame', 'Congress', ""Michael Jackson's"", 'Thriller', ""the National Film Preservation Board's"", 'National Film Registry', 'Thriller', 'present-day', 'Thriller']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PRODUCT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT']"

The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), every four years, with first qualification rounds leading up to a semifinals  and then finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is considered the ""flagship event of the international cricket calendar"" by the ICC.The first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.
The World Cup is open to all members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), although the highest-ranking teams receive automatic qualification. The remaining teams are determined via the World Cricket League and the ICC World Cup Qualifier. A total of twenty teams have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen teams competing in 2015; the recent 2019 tournament only had ten teams. Australia has won the tournament five times, India and West Indies twice each, while Pakistan, Sri Lanka and England have won it once each. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament.

440,1984,January,24,Apple Computer Inc unveils its revolutionary Macintosh personal computer,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Apple_Inc.,"Apple Inc., formerly Apple Computer, Inc., is a multinational corporation that creates consumer electronics, personal computers, servers, and computer software, and is a digital distributor of media content. The company also has a chain of retail stores known as Apple Stores. Apple's core product lines are the iPhone smartphone, iPad tablet computer, iPod portable media players, and Macintosh computer line. Founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created Apple Computer on April 1, 1976, and incorporated the company on January 3, 1977, in Cupertino, California.
For more than three decades, Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and Power Mac lines, but it faced rocky sales and low market share during the 1990s. Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1996 after his company NeXT was bought by Apple. The following year he became the company's interim CEO, which later became permanent. Jobs subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of recognizable products and simple design, starting with the original iMac in 1998.
With the introduction of the successful iPod music player in 2001 and iTunes Music Store in 2003, Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries, leading it to drop ""Computer"" from the company's name in 2007. The company is now also known for its iOS range of smart phone, media player, and tablet computer products that began with the iPhone, followed by the iPod Touch and then iPad. As of 30 June 2015, Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization, with an estimated value of US$1 trillion as of August 2, 2018. Apple's worldwide annual revenue in 2010 totaled US$65 billion, growing to US$127.8 billion in 2011 and $156 billion in 2012.","{1025, 3842, 2, 2051, 901, 3970, 7, 4235, 2703, 1177, 5022, 3998, 4768, 4134, 177, 2483, 4539, 2875, 4413, 4549, 967, 968, 2122, 971, 2507, 4682, 4815, 2258, 595, 3154, 3666, 4307, 471, 2141, 355, 5092, 874, 3180, 1649, 4981, 2169, 4474, 3451}",43,"['Apple Computer Inc', 'Macintosh', 'Apple Inc.', 'Apple Computer, Inc.', 'Apple Stores', 'Apple', 'iPhone', 'Macintosh', 'Steve Jobs', 'Steve Wozniak', 'Apple Computer', 'April 1, 1976', 'January 3, 1977', 'Cupertino', 'California', 'more than three decades', 'Apple Computer', 'the Apple II', 'Macintosh', 'Power Mac', 'the 1990s', '1985', 'Apple', '1996', 'NeXT', 'Apple', 'The following year', '1998', '2001', 'iTunes Music Store', '2003', 'Apple', '2007', 'iOS', 'iPhone', 'the iPod Touch', 'June 2015', 'Apple', 'August 2, 2018', 'Apple', 'annual', '2010', '2011', '2012']","['ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE']"
441,1984,February,29,Pierre Trudeau announces he is stepping down after 15 years as Canadian Prime Minister,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau,"Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau  ( TROO-doh, troo-DOH, French: [pjɛʁ tʁydo]; October 18, 1919 – September 28, 2000), mostly referred to as simply Pierre Trudeau, or by the initials PET, was a Canadian politician who was the 15th prime minister of Canada and leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, between 1968 and 1984, with a brief period as Leader of the Opposition, from 1979 to 1980. His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada's third longest-serving Prime Minister, behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald.
Trudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer, intellectual, and activist in Québec politics. He joined the Liberal Party and was elected to the Canadian Parliament in 1965, quickly being appointed as Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson's Parliamentary Secretary. In 1967, he was appointed Minister of Justice. Trudeau's outgoing personality caused a media sensation, inspiring ""Trudeaumania"", and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968, when he was appointed Prime Minister of Canada.
From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, Trudeau's personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life. After his appointment as Prime Minister, he won the 1968, 1972 and 1974 elections, before narrowly losing in 1979. He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards, in 1980, and eventually retired from politics shortly before the 1984 election.
Despite his personal motto, ""Reason before passion"", his personality and political career aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office. Admirers praised what they consider to be the force of Trudeau's intellect and his political acumen, maintaining national unity over the Quebec sovereignty movement, suppressing a Québec terrorist crisis, fostering a pan-Canadian identity, and in achieving sweeping institutional reform, including the implementation of official bilingualism, patriation of the Constitution, and the establishment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Critics accused him of arrogance, of economic mismanagement, and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Québec and the economy of the Prairies.His eldest son, Justin Trudeau, became the 23rd and current Prime Minister, following the 2015 election and 2019 election, and is the first prime minister of Canada to be a descendant of a former prime minister.",{4741},1,"['Pierre Trudeau', '15 years', 'Canadian', 'Joseph Philippe Pierre', 'Elliott Trudeau', 'troo-DOH', 'French', 'October 18, 1919', 'September 28, 2000', 'Pierre Trudeau', 'PET', 'Canadian', 'Canada', 'the Liberal Party of Canada', 'between 1968 and 1984', 'from 1979 to 1980', '15 years', '164 days', 'Canada', 'William Lyon Mackenzie King', 'John A.

442,1984,April,23,AIDS-virus identified as HTLV-III (acquired immune deficiency syndrome),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS,"Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Following initial infection a person may not notice any symptoms, or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. If the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors which are otherwise rare in people who have normal immune function. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss.HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva, sweat and tears, do not transmit the virus. HIV is a member of the group of viruses known as retroviruses.Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11 years.In 2018 about 37.9 million people were living with HIV and it resulted in 770,000 deaths. An estimated 20.6 million of these live in eastern and southern Africa. Between the time that AIDS was identified (in the early 1980s) and 2018, the disease caused an estimated 32 million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading. HIV made the jump from other primates to humans in west-central Africa in the early-to-mid 20th century. AIDS was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause—HIV infection—was identified in the early part of the decade.
HIV/AIDS has had a large impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has large economic impacts. There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion, including the Catholic Church's position not to support condom use as prevention. It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.",set(),0,"['HTLV-III', '11 years', '2018', 'Africa', 'the early 1980s', '2018', 'Africa', 'mid 20th century', 'the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CDC', '1981', 'the decade', ""the Catholic Church's"", 'the 1980s']","['ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE']"

It is considered to be the world's worst industrial disaster. Over 500,000 people were exposed to methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas. The highly toxic substance made its way into and around the small towns located near the plant.Estimates vary on the death toll. The official immediate death toll was 2,259. In 2008, the government of Madhya Pradesh had paid compensation to the family members of 3,787 victims killed in the gas release, and to 574,366 injured victims. A government affidavit in 2006 stated that the leak caused 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries. Others estimate that 8,000 died within two weeks, and another 8,000 or more have since died from gas-related diseases.  The cause of the disaster remains under debate. The Indian government and local activists argue that slack management and deferred maintenance created a situation where routine pipe maintenance caused a backflow of water into a MIC tank, triggering the disaster. Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) argues water entered the tank through an act of sabotage.
The owner of the factory, UCIL, was majority owned by UCC, with Indian Government-controlled banks and the Indian public holding a 49.1 percent stake. In 1989, UCC paid $470 million (equivalent to $845 million in 2018) to settle litigation stemming from the disaster. In 1994, UCC sold its stake in UCIL to Eveready Industries India Limited (EIIL), which subsequently merged with McLeod Russel (India) Ltd. Eveready ended clean-up on the site in 1998, when it terminated its 99-year lease and turned over control of the site to the state government of Madhya Pradesh. Dow Chemical Company purchased UCC in 2001, seventeen years after the disaster.
Civil and criminal cases filed in the United States against UCC and Warren Anderson, UCC CEO at the time of the disaster, were dismissed and redirected to Indian courts on multiple occasions between 1986 and 2012, as the US courts focused on UCIL being a standalone entity of India. Civil and criminal cases were also filed in the District Court of Bhopal, India, involving UCC, UCIL and UCC CEO Anderson. In June 2010, seven Indian nationals who were UCIL employees in 1984, including the former UCIL chairman, were convicted in Bhopal of causing death by negligence and sentenced to two years imprisonment and a fine of about $2,000 each, the maximum punishment allowed by Indian law. All were released on bail shortly after the verdict. An eighth former employee was also convicted, but died before the judgement was passed.

He received critical acclaim for his early 1970s albums and attained worldwide fame upon the release of Born to Run in 1975. During a career that has spanned five decades, Springsteen has become known for his poetic and socially conscious lyrics and lengthy, energetic stage performances, earning the nickname ""The Boss"". He has recorded both rock albums and folk-oriented works, and his lyrics often address the experiences and struggles of working-class Americans.
Born in the U.S.A. (1984) is Springsteen's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful album, proving him to be one of the most successful rock figures of the 1980s. It was certified 15x Platinum in the US and has sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Seven of its singles reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 including the title track, which was a bitter commentary on the treatment of Vietnam veterans — some of whom were Springsteen's friends. Advocating for the rights of the common working-class man, the song made a huge political impact. Springsteen's other best-known songs include ""Born to Run"" (1975), ""Thunder Road"" (1975), ""Badlands"" (1978), ""Hungry Heart"" (1980), ""Dancing in the Dark"" (1984), ""Glory Days"" (1985), ""Brilliant Disguise"" (1987), ""Human Touch"" (1992), ""Streets of Philadelphia"" (1994), and ""The Rising"" (2002).
Springsteen has sold more than 135 million records worldwide and more than 64 million records in the United States, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Tony Award (for Springsteen on Broadway). Springsteen was inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999, received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2009, was named MusiCares person of the year in 2013, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2016.","{1378, 4741}",2,"['Born in the USA', 'Bruce Springsteen', 'Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen', 'September 23, 1949', 'American', 'the E Street Band', 'Born to Run', '1975', 'five decades', 'Springsteen', 'The Boss', 'Americans', 'U.S.A.', '1984', 'Springsteen', 'the 1980s', 'US', 'Vietnam', 'Springsteen', 'Springsteen', 'Born to Run', '1975', 'Thunder Road', '1975', 'Badlands', '1978', 'Hungry Heart', '1980', 'Dancing in the Dark', '1984', 'Glory Days', '1985', 'Brilliant Disguise', '1987', 'Human Touch', '1992', 'Streets of Philadelphia', '1994', 'The Rising', '2002', 'the United States', 'Grammy Awards', 'Golden Globes', 'a Tony Award', 'Springsteen on Broadway', 'Springsteen', 'the Songwriters Hall of Fame', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame', '1999', 'the Kennedy Center Honors', '2009', 'MusiCares', 'the year', '2013', 'the Presidential Medal of Freedom', 'Barack Obama', '2016']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"
452,1984,June,25,"Prince releases his ""Purple Rain"" album",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician),"Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, dancer, actor, and filmmaker. A guitar virtuoso and multi-instrumentalist known for his genre-crossing work, flamboyant stage appearances and wide-ranging singing voice, in particular his far reaching falsetto  and high-pitched screams, he is regarded as one of the greatest, versatile and most successful musicians in the history of popular music. His innovative music integrated a wide variety of styles, including funk, R&B, rock, new wave, soul, psychedelia, and pop. Prince pioneered the late 1970s Minneapolis sound, a funk rock subgenre drawing from synth-pop and new wave.Born and raised in Minneapolis, Prince developed an interest in music as a young child and wrote his first song, ""Funk Machine"", at the age of seven. He signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, and released his debut album For You in 1978. Following up with his next four albums—Prince (1979), Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982)—Prince gained critical success, prominently showcasing his explicit lyrics as well as his blending of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released his sixth album Purple Rain, which was also the soundtrack to his hugely successful film acting debut of the same name. It quickly became his most commercially successful record, spending 24 consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200. The film itself was critically and commercially successful and also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score, the last film to receive the award.
Following the disbandment of The Revolution, Prince released the critically acclaimed double album Sign o' the Times (1987). He released three more solo albums—Lovesexy (1988), the Batman soundtrack (1989), and the Graffiti Bridge soundtrack (1990)—before debuting his New Power Generation backing band in 1991. In the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros. in 1993, Prince changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol , known to fans as the ""Love Symbol"", and began releasing new albums at a faster rate in order to quickly meet his contract quota and release himself from further obligations to the record label. He released five records between 1994 and 1996 before he signed with Arista Records in 1998. He began referring to himself as ""Prince"" again in 2000 and subsequently released 16 albums, including Musicology (2004), his most successful album of that decade. His final album, Hit n Run Phase Two, was first released on the Tidal streaming service in 2015.
In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. He sold over 100 million records worldwide, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. He won seven Grammy Awards, seven Brit Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was also honored with special awards including the Grammy President's Merit Award, American Music Awards for Achievement and of Merit, and the Billboard Icon Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016. In 2016, he was posthumously honored with a Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Minnesota.

An alumnus of the DJK Würzburg basketball club, Nowitzki was chosen as the ninth pick in the 1998 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks and was immediately traded to the Dallas Mavericks, where he played his entire 21-year National Basketball Association (NBA) career.
Listed at 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m), Nowitzki is widely regarded as one of the greatest power forwards of all time and he is considered by many to be the greatest European player of all time. Nowitzki led the Mavericks to 15 NBA playoff appearances (2001–2012; 2014–2016), including the franchise's first Finals appearance in 2006 and its only NBA championship in 2011. Known for his scoring ability, his versatility, his accurate outside shooting, and his trademark fadeaway jump shot, Nowitzki won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award in 2007 and the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in 2011.
Nowitzki is the only player ever to play for a single NBA franchise for 21 seasons. He is a 14-time All-Star, a 12-time All-NBA Team member, the first European player to start in an All-Star Game, and the first European player to receive the NBA Most Valuable Player Award.

She was a famous redhead who was known for playing fiercely passionate, but sensible heroines, often in westerns and adventure films. On numerous occasions, she worked with director John Ford and longtime friend John Wayne. O'Hara was one of the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood.
O'Hara grew up in Dublin in a Catholic family and aspired to become an actress from a very young age. She trained with the Rathmines Theatre Company from the age of 10 and at the Abbey Theatre from the age of 14. She was given a screen test, which was deemed unsatisfactory, but Charles Laughton saw potential and arranged for her to co-star with him in Alfred Hitchcock's Jamaica Inn in 1939. She moved to Hollywood the same year to appear with him in the production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and was given a contract by RKO Pictures. From there, she went on to enjoy a long and highly successful career, and acquired the nickname ""The Queen of Technicolor"".
She appeared in films such as How Green Was My Valley (1941) (her first collaboration with John Ford), The Black Swan with Tyrone Power (1942), The Spanish Main (1945), Sinbad the Sailor (1947), the Christmas classic Miracle on 34th Street (1947) with John Payne and Natalie Wood, and Comanche Territory (1950).
O'Hara made her first film with John Wayne, the actor with whom she is most closely associated, in Rio Grande (1950). This was followed by The Quiet Man (1952), The Wings of Eagles (1957), McLintock! (1963) and Big Jake (1971). Such was her strong chemistry with Wayne that many assumed they were married or in a relationship.
In the 1960s O'Hara increasingly turned to more motherly roles as she aged, appearing in films such as The Deadly Companions (1961), The Parent Trap (1961) and The Rare Breed (1966). She retired from the industry in 1971 but returned 20 years later to appear with John Candy in Only the Lonely (1991).
In the late 1970s, O'Hara helped run her third husband Charles F. Blair, Jr.'s flying business in Saint Croix in the United States Virgin Islands, and edited a magazine, but later sold them to spend more time in Glengarriff in Ireland.

Most of the community emigrated to Israel in the late 20th century.The Beta Israel lived in northern and northwestern Ethiopia, in more than 500 small villages spread over a wide territory, alongside populations that were Muslim and predominantly Christian. Most of them were concentrated mainly on what are today, North Gondar Zone, Shire Inda Selassie, Wolqayit, Tselemti, Dembia, Segelt, Quara, and Belesa. They practiced Haymanot religious practices, which are generally recognized as an Israelite religion that differs from Rabbinic Judaism. Beta Israel appear to have been isolated from mainstream Jewish communities for at least a millennium. Beta Israel’s customs have developed against modern Jewish practice, yet align perfectly with rituals from the time of the Second Temple, described in the Dead Sea Scrolls. . They suffered religious persecution and a significant portion of the community were forced into Christianity during the 19th and 20th centuries; those converted became known as the Falash Mura. The larger Beta Abraham Christian community with pseudo-Israelite practices is also considered to have historical links to Beta Israel.The Beta Israel made contact with other Jewish communities in the later 20th century. Following this, a rabbinic debate ensued over whether or not the Beta Israel were Jews. After halakhic (Jewish law) and constitutional discussions, Israeli officials decided, in 1977, that the Israeli Law of Return was to be applied to the Beta Israel. The Israeli and American governments mounted aliyah (immigration to Israel) transport operations. These activities included Operation Brothers in Sudan between 1979 and 1990 (this includes the major Operation Moses and Operation Joshua), and in the 1990s from Addis Ababa (which includes Operation Solomon).By the end of 2008, there were 119,300 people of Ethiopian descent in Israel, including nearly 81,000 people born in Ethiopia and about 38,500 native-born Israelis (about 32 percent of the community) with at least one parent born in Ethiopia or Eritrea. The Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel is mostly composed of Beta Israel (practicing both Haymanot and Rabbinic Judaism) and to a smaller extent of Falash Mura who converted from Christianity to Rabbinic Judaism upon their arrival to Israel.","{595, 4815}",2,"['Israel', 'Ethiopian', 'Hebrew', 'Beta ʾƏsrāʾel', ""Bēte 'Isrā'ēl"", 'EAE', 'Betä Ǝsraʾel', 'House of Israel', 'Community of Israel', 'Ethiopian', 'Jews', 'Hebrew', 'Yehudey Etyopyah', 'የኢትዮጵያ አይሁድዊ', 'ye-Ityoppya Ayhudi', 'Jewish', 'centuries', 'the Kingdom of Aksum', 'the Ethiopian Empire', 'Amhara', 'Tigray', 'Ethiopia', 'Eritrea', 'Israel', 'the late 20th century', 'Israel', 'Ethiopia', 'Muslim', 'Christian', 'North Gondar Zone', 'Shire Inda Selassie', 'Wolqayit', 'Dembia', 'Segelt', 'Quara', 'Belesa', 'Rabbinic Judaism', 'Israel', 'Jewish', 'at least a millennium', 'Israel', 'Jewish', 'the Second Temple', 'the Dead Sea Scrolls', 'Christianity', 'the 19th and 20th centuries', 'the Falash Mura', 'Beta Abraham Christian', 'Beta Israel', 'Jewish', 'the later 20th century', 'Israel', 'Jews', 'Jewish', 'Israeli', '1977', 'the Israeli Law of Return', 'the Beta Israel', 'Israeli', 'American', 'Israel', 'Operation Brothers', 'Sudan', 'between 1979 and 1990', 'Operation Moses', 'Operation Joshua', 'the 1990s', 'Addis Ababa', 'Operation Solomon).By', 'the end of 2008', 'Ethiopian', 'Israel', 'Ethiopia', 'Israelis', 'about 32 percent', 'Ethiopia', 'Eritrea', 'Ethiopian', 'Jewish', 'Israel', 'Falash Mura', 'Christianity', 'Israel']","['GPE', 'NORP', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'LANGUAGE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERCENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE']"

He served as the last Prime Minister from 1978 to 1984 and the first executive State President from 1984 to 1989.
First elected to Parliament in 1948, Botha was an outspoken opponent of majority rule and international communism. However, his administration did make concessions towards political reform, whereas internal unrest saw widespread human rights abuses at the hands of the government. Botha resigned as leader of the ruling National Party (NP) in February 1989 after suffering a stroke and six months later was also coerced to leave the presidency.
In F. W. de Klerk's 1992 apartheid referendum, Botha campaigned for a No vote and denounced De Klerk's administration as irresponsible for opening the door to black majority rule. In early 1998, when Botha refused to testify at the Mandela government's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), he was supported by the right-wing Conservative Party, which had earlier contested his rule as the official opposition. For his refusal, he was fined and given a suspended jail sentence for crimes against humanity. The sentence was overturned on appeal. Shortly before his death in late 2006, he renewed his opposition towards egalitarian democracy in favour of a confederate system based upon the principles of ""separate development"".","{258, 835, 260, 3430, 1676, 145, 2264, 5051}",8,"['South African', 'P.

He led the Soviet Union from 13 February 1984 until his death on 10 March 1985.
Born to a poor family from Siberia, Chernenko joined Komsomol (the Communist Party's youth league) in 1929 and became a full member of the party in 1931. After holding a series of propaganda posts, in 1948 he became the head of the propaganda department in Moldavia, serving under Leonid Brezhnev. After Brezhnev took over as First Secretary of the CPSU in 1964, Chernenko rose to head the General Department of the Central Committee, responsible for setting the agenda for the Politburo and drafting Central Committee decrees. In 1971 Chernenko became a full member of the Central Committee, and in 1978 he was made a full member of the Politburo.
After the death of Brezhnev and his successor Yuri Andropov, Chernenko was elected General Secretary in February 1984 and made Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in April 1984. Due to his rapidly failing health, he was often unable to fulfill his official duties. He died in March 1985 after leading the country for only 13 months, and was succeeded as General Secretary by Mikhail Gorbachev.","{128, 640, 4736, 903, 7, 4235, 1555, 3348, 4768, 2210, 3874, 1960, 4905, 4539, 2875, 4413, 4549, 967, 2122, 971, 2507, 4682, 4815, 595, 3795, 4307, 5077, 2525, 2529, 358, 3180, 3951, 625, 3702, 2169, 4474}",36,"['Mikhail Gorbachev', 'Konstantin Chernenko', 'Soviet', 'Konstantin Ustinovich Chernenko', 'Russian', 'Константин Устинович Черненко', '24 September 1911', '1985', 'Soviet', 'the Communist Party', 'the Soviet Union', 'the Soviet Union', 'February 1984', '10 March 1985', 'Siberia', 'Chernenko', 'Komsomol', ""the Communist Party's"", '1929', '1931', '1948', 'the propaganda department', 'Moldavia', 'Leonid Brezhnev', 'Brezhnev', 'CPSU', '1964', 'Chernenko', 'the General Department of the Central Committee', 'Politburo', 'Central Committee', '1971', 'Chernenko', 'the Central Committee', '1978', 'Politburo', 'Brezhnev', 'Yuri Andropov', 'Chernenko', 'General', 'February 1984', 'the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet', 'April 1984', 'March 1985', 'only 13 months', 'Mikhail Gorbachev']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON']"

The original event was organised by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise funds for relief of the ongoing Ethiopian famine. Billed as the ""global jukebox"", the event was held simultaneously at Wembley Stadium in London, England, United Kingdom (attended by about 72,000 people) and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States (attended by exactly 89,484 people).On the same day, concerts inspired by the initiative happened in other countries, such as the Soviet Union, Canada, Japan, Yugoslavia, Austria, Australia and West Germany. It was one of the largest-scale satellite link-ups and television broadcasts of all time; an estimated audience of 1.9 billion, across 150 nations, watched the live broadcast, nearly 40% of the world population.The impact of Live Aid on famine relief has been debated for years. One aid relief worker stated that following the publicity generated by the concert, ""humanitarian concern is now at the centre of foreign policy"" for western governments. Geldof states, ""We took an issue that was nowhere on the political agenda and, through the lingua franca of the planet – which is not English but rock 'n' roll – we were able to address the intellectual absurdity and the moral repulsion of people dying of want in a world of surplus."" He adds, Live Aid ""created something permanent and self-sustaining"", but also asked why Africa is getting poorer. The organisers of Live Aid tried, without much success, to run aid efforts directly, channelling millions of pounds to NGOs in Ethiopia. Much of this, however, went to the Ethiopian government of Mengistu Haile Mariam – a regime the UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wanted to ""destabilise"" – and was spent on guns.","{4611, 2051, 1540, 4101, 7, 2568, 3598, 1555, 3608, 2080, 1569, 4642, 1573, 3109, 4134, 1583, 2096, 4661, 1081, 2122, 4682, 4174, 4688, 595, 2141, 607, 1631, 1633, 613, 620, 3180, 1646, 2159, 1136, 1649, 3186, 2679, 2169, 2682, 3195, 635, 2171, 127, 640, 1153, 4605, 3724, 1678, 1167, 2703, 3727, 1683, 1177, 2713, 4768, 1185, 2210, 1699, 4770, 4775, 3243, 1710, 175, 3252, 4799, 3268, 2760, 1739, 4815, 2771, 3795, 4307, 3799, 3803, 1251, 3812, 3303, 744, 2793, 2794, 1265, 1780, 757, 3322, 3842, 1288, 1291, 1803, 2322, 3862, 4895, 290, 1828, 3365, 2342, 1319, 4905, 810, 812, 4910, 1847, 826, 2875, 4924, 2368, 1867, 2891, 4430, 4944, 1873, 2901, 3413, 1888, 3936, 1890, 870, 874, 3434, 1388, 4971, 2415, 889, 4474, 3451, 892, 4986, 4990, 3970, 387, 4994, 1418, 2955, 3979, 4496, 3994, 3489, 418, 1960, 2984, 5037, 4526, 2483, 3508, 1979, 4539, 3520, 3524, 4549, 967, 971, 2507, 1997, 4561, 5077, 3034, 1508, 5097, 2026, 1006, 1008, 1526, 2039, 5117}",163,"['Wembley Stadium', 'London', 'John F.

It is a stratovolcano composed of many layers of lava alternating with hardened volcanic ash and other pyroclastic rocks. Volcanic activity at Nevado del Ruiz began about two million years ago, since the Early Pleistocene or Late Pliocene, with three major eruptive periods. The current volcanic cone formed during the present eruptive period, which began 150 thousand years ago.
The volcano usually generates Vulcanian to Plinian eruptions, which produce swift-moving currents of hot gas and rock called pyroclastic flows. These eruptions often cause massive lahars (mud and debris flows), which pose a threat to human life and the environment.  The impact of such an eruption is increased as the hot gas and lava melt the mountain's snowcap, adding large quantities of water to the flow. On November 13, 1985, a small eruption produced an enormous lahar that buried and destroyed the town of Armero in Tolima, causing an estimated 25,000 deaths. This event later became known as the Armero tragedy—the deadliest lahar in recorded history. Similar but less deadly incidents occurred in 1595 and 1845, consisting of a small explosive eruption followed by a large lahar.
The volcano is part of Los Nevados National Natural Park, which also contains several other volcanoes. The summit of Nevado del Ruiz is covered by large glaciers.  The volcano continues to pose a threat to the nearby towns and villages, and it is estimated that up to 500,000 people could be at risk from lahars from future eruptions.
Today, the Nevado del Ruiz volcano is constantly monitored by the Volcanic and Seismic Observatory of Manizales.","{2051, 6, 1031, 7, 523, 1041, 2069, 1559, 1562, 4123, 28, 1566, 2080, 4643, 550, 4134, 3625, 1066, 1583, 2096, 4154, 2119, 3656, 2122, 4682, 1616, 595, 1622, 2649, 2141, 607, 3167, 1633, 3682, 4199, 3180, 1646, 1136, 3190, 2682, 640, 1153, 1678, 3727, 1177, 1178, 1183, 4255, 2721, 2210, 4768, 1701, 2217, 3243, 1709, 188, 4800, 2245, 202, 1739, 1740, 4815, 3795, 4307, 2262, 3803, 1251, 3299, 1765, 3811, 3812, 4324, 2793, 2794, 3833, 3322, 3842, 1288, 1804, 269, 273, 1299, 3862, 287, 4895, 290, 4899, 3365, 1830, 3877, 4905, 2865, 2874, 2875, 2878, 1346, 1865, 4430, 2896, 2901, 3413, 2391, 1372, 861, 1888, 1890, 2916, 873, 4971, 1388, 3436, 3437, 2415, 889, 890, 3451, 892, 4474, 895, 4480, 3457, 386, 387, 4993, 1925, 1414, 391, 4487, 4994, 3979, 5003, 3989, 3489, 418, 2483, 1466, 1979, 4539, 3519, 3520, 964, 3524, 4549, 967, 971, 2507, 2509, 4561, 467, 4051, 5077, 471, 1502, 3553, 1508, 3049, 2026, 4589, 1526, 2039, 504, 4601}",162,"['Nevado del Ruiz', 'Colombia', 'Armero', 'The Nevado del Ruiz', 'Spanish', 'La Mesa de Herveo', 'English', 'Mesa of Herveo', 'Caldas and Tolima', 'Colombia', 'Bogotá', 'Nevado del Ruiz', 'about two million years ago', 'the Early Pleistocene', 'Late Pliocene', '150 thousand years ago', 'Vulcanian', 'Plinian', 'November 13, 1985', 'Armero', 'Tolima', 'Armero', '1595', '1845', 'Los Nevados National Natural Park', 'Nevado del Ruiz', 'Today', 'the Nevado del Ruiz', 'Volcanic', 'Seismic Observatory', 'Manizales']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'LANGUAGE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'GPE']"
471,1985,November,19,US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev meet for first time,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan,"The presidency of Ronald Reagan began at noon EST on January 20, 1981, when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as the 40th President of the United States, and ended on January 20, 1989. Reagan, a Republican from California, took office following a landslide victory over Democratic incumbent President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election. Reagan was succeeded by his Vice President, George H. W. Bush, who won the 1988 presidential election with Reagan's support. Reagan's 1980 election resulted from a dramatic conservative shift to the right in American politics, including a loss of confidence in liberal, New Deal, and Great Society programs and priorities that had dominated the national agenda since the 1930s.
Domestically, the Reagan administration enacted a major tax cut, sought to cut non-military spending, and eliminated federal regulations. The administration's economic policies, known as ""Reaganomics"", were inspired by supply-side economics. The combination of tax cuts and an increase in defense spending led to budget deficits, and the federal debt increased significantly during Reagan's tenure. Reagan signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (which simplified the tax code by reducing rates and removing several tax breaks) and the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (which enacted sweeping changes to U.S. immigration law and granted amnesty to three million illegal immigrants). Reagan also appointed more federal judges than any other president, including four Supreme Court Justices.
Reagan's foreign policy stance was resolutely anti-communist; its plan of action, known as the Reagan Doctrine, sought to roll back the global influence of the Soviet Union in an attempt to end the Cold War. Under this doctrine, the Reagan administration initiated a massive buildup of the United States military; promoted new technologies such as missile defense systems; and, in 1983, undertook an invasion of Grenada, the first major overseas action by U.S. troops since the end of the Vietnam War. The administration also created controversy by granting aid to paramilitary forces seeking to overthrow leftist governments, particularly in war-torn Central America and Afghanistan. Specifically, the Reagan administration engaged in covert arms sales to Iran to fund Contra rebels in Nicaragua that were fighting to overthrow their nation's socialist government; the resulting scandal led to the conviction or resignation of several administration officials. During Reagan's second term, he sought closer relations with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and the two leaders signed a major arms control agreement known as the INF Treaty.
Leaving office in 1989, Reagan held an approval rating of 68%. This rating matches the approval ratings of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Bill Clinton as the highest rating for a departing president in the modern era. Historians and political scientists generally rank Reagan as an above-average president. Due to Reagan's impact on public discourse and advocacy of American conservatism, some historians have described the period during and after his presidency as the Reagan Era.","{1378, 4741}",2,"['US', 'Ronald Reagan', 'Soviet', 'Mikhail Gorbachev', 'Ronald Reagan', 'January 20, 1981', 'Ronald Reagan', 'the United States', 'January 20, 1989', 'Reagan', 'Republican', 'California', 'Democratic', 'Jimmy Carter', '1980', 'Reagan', 'George H.

It was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and produced by Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian for the album We Are the World. With sales in excess of 20 million copies, it is the eighth  best-selling physical single of all time.
Following Band Aid's 1984 ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" project in the UK, an idea for the creation of an American benefit single for African famine relief came from activist Harry Belafonte, who, along with fundraiser Ken Kragen, was instrumental in bringing the vision to reality. Several musicians were contacted by the pair, before Jackson and Lionel Richie were assigned the task of writing the song. The duo completed the writing of ""We Are the World"" seven weeks after the release of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"", and one night before the song's first recording session, on January 21, 1985. The historic event brought together some of the most well-known artists in the music industry at the time.
The song was released on March 7, 1985, as the first single from the album. A worldwide commercial success, topping music charts throughout the world and becoming the fastest-selling U.S. pop single in history. The first ever single to be certified multi-platinum, ""We Are the World"" received a Quadruple Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.
Awarded numerous honors—including three Grammy Awards, one American Music Award, and a People's Choice Award—the song was promoted with a critically received music video, a VHS, a special edition magazine, a simulcast, and several books, posters, and shirts. The promotion and merchandise aided the success of ""We Are the World"" and raised over $63 million (equivalent to $147 million today) for humanitarian aid in Africa and the US.
Following the devastation caused by the magnitude 7.0 M earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010, a remake of the song by another all-star cast of singers was recorded on February 1, 2010. Entitled ""We Are the World 25 for Haiti"", it was released as a single on February 12, 2010, and proceeds from the record aided survivors in the impoverished country.
In March 2020, Richie suggested that a third remake should be made to communicate a message of global solidarity in the face of the coronavirus pandemic and raise funds for aid efforts.","{1026, 4611, 6, 1031, 7, 521, 2568, 3970, 524, 528, 4113, 3090, 2579, 2069, 1562, 4123, 2589, 2078, 1566, 33, 4643, 550, 39, 1576, 2601, 1066, 3625, 4134, 4647, 1583, 2096, 561, 2104, 1081, 4154, 2628, 70, 2119, 2122, 4682, 4683, 4688, 595, 2131, 1622, 2647, 2649, 3167, 4704, 1633, 3682, 2152, 2155, 1133, 2159, 1136, 1649, 2169, 2682, 3195, 2170, 635, 640, 1153, 4736, 131, 2176, 1162, 2703, 144, 3727, 1683, 1178, 3228, 1183, 4255, 2721, 2210, 4768, 2213, 4774, 1192, 1193, 2217, 174, 4800, 3777, 2245, 198, 1228, 717, 2764, 3277, 4815, 2771, 3795, 4307, 4313, 3804, 3805, 3808, 1251, 3299, 1765, 3811, 3303, 4324, 2793, 2794, 748, 2798, 1783, 3833, 3322, 1275, 3834, 4859, 767, 257, 3842, 1795, 1288, 1804, 269, 1808, 273, 1299, 3348, 3869, 287, 4895, 290, 3874, 1828, 294, 807, 1319, 1830, 4905, 1323, 815, 4400, 2865, 4916, 310, 311, 1847, 826, 2875, 2878, 3903, 3908, 1865, 2379, 2891, 4941, 4942, 2896, 2901, 1372, 861, 1888, 2916, 4967, 873, 4971, 1388, 2415, 1908, 885, 889, 4474, 3451, 4990, 895, 4480, 4993, 4994, 3457, 386, 387, 900, 1925, 1414, 391, 903, 3459, 3460, 3468, 3978, 4487, 5003, 401, 3989, 1432, 3999, 3489, 418, 4518, 423, 1960, 4007, 5033, 4014, 4020, 4024, 1466, 4539, 5059, 452, 964, 1990, 4549, 5065, 971, 2507, 1997, 2508, 2509, 5077, 471, 5079, 3034, 1502, 3040, 2018, 1508, 504, 3049, 2026, 492, 5106, 5107, 1526, 1015, 2040, 4601}",237,"['We Are the World', 'Africa', 'Michael Jackson', 'We Are the World', 'Africa', '1985', 'Michael Jackson', 'Lionel Richie', 'Quincy Jones', 'Michael Omartian', '1984', 'Do They Know', 'Christmas', 'UK', 'American', 'African', 'Harry Belafonte', 'Ken Kragen', 'Jackson', 'Lionel Richie', 'We Are the World', 'seven weeks', ""Do They Know It's Christmas"", 'January 21, 1985', 'March 7, 1985', 'U.S.', 'We Are the World', 'Quadruple Platinum', 'the Recording Industry Association of America', 'Grammy Awards', 'American', 'VHS', 'We Are the World', 'today', 'Africa', 'US', 'Haiti', 'January 12, 2010', 'February 1, 2010', 'We Are the World 25 for Haiti', 'February 12, 2010', 'March 2020', 'Richie']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG']"

They compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Central Division of the Western Conference. They have won six Stanley Cup championships since their founding in 1926. The Blackhawks are one of the ""Original Six"" NHL teams along with the Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins and New York Rangers. Since 1994, the club's home rink is the United Center, which they share with the National Basketball Association's Chicago Bulls. The club had previously played for 65 years at Chicago Stadium.The club's original owner was Frederic McLaughlin, who owned the club until his death in 1944. Under McLaughlin, a ""hands-on"" owner who fired many coaches during his ownership, the club won two Stanley Cup titles. The club was then owned by the Norris family, who as owners of the Chicago Stadium were the club's landlord, and owned stakes in several of the NHL teams. At first, the Norris ownership was as part of a syndicate fronted by long-time executive Bill Tobin, and the team languished in favor of the Norris-owned Detroit Red Wings. After the senior James E. Norris died in 1952, the Norris assets were spread among family members and James D. Norris became owner. Norris Jr. took an active interest in the team and under his ownership, the club won one Stanley Cup title in 1961.
After James D. Norris died in 1966, the Wirtz family became owners of the franchise. In 2007, the club came under the control of Rocky Wirtz, who is credited with turning around the organization, which had lost fan interest and competitiveness.

477,1985,April,18,Wham become the first western pop act to release an album in China,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxette,"Roxette was a Swedish pop rock  duo, consisting of Marie Fredriksson (vocals and keyboards) and Per Gessle (vocals and guitar). Formed in 1986, the duo became an international act in the late 1980s, when they released their breakthrough album Look Sharp! Their third album Joyride, which was released in 1991, became just as successful as its predecessor. Roxette went on to achieve nineteen UK Top 40 hits and several US Hot 100 hits, including four US number-ones with ""The Look"", ""Listen to Your Heart"", ""It Must Have Been Love"", featured on the soundtrack of Pretty Woman, and ""Joyride"". Their other hits include ""Dressed for Success"", ""Dangerous"", and ""Fading Like a Flower"".Before coming together to form the duo, Fredriksson and Gessle were already established artists in Sweden, she having released a number of solo albums and he being the lead singer and songwriter of Gyllene Tider, a band that had three No. 1 albums. On the advice of the managing director of their record label, the two came together to record ""Neverending Love"", which became a hit single in Sweden.
After the release of Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!, a greatest hits record, the duo took a hiatus before returning with the albums Have a Nice Day (1999) and Room Service (2001). They continued to chart in other territories, mainly in Europe and Latin America, where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards until the beginning of the new millennium. In 2002, the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Gessle went on to release solo albums and reunited with Gyllene Tider before Roxette took to the stage together again for the first time in eight years, in 2009, during Gessle's European Party Crasher tour. In 2011, they released Charm School, their first studio album in ten years, which was followed by Travelling in 2012. Their final studio album, Good Karma, was released in 2016.
Their songs ""It Must Have Been Love"" and ""Listen to Your Heart"" continue to receive wide radio airplay, with both singles recently receiving awards from BMI for achieving five million radio plays. They have sold an estimated 75 million records worldwide, with over 10 million in certified units from Germany, the US and the UK, achieving gold and platinum certifications for Joyride and Look Sharp! in all three regions. They are Sweden's second-best-selling music act after ABBA.","{1025, 2051, 4101, 7, 3090, 1562, 2589, 4642, 1573, 4134, 4647, 1576, 2096, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4688, 595, 2141, 3686, 619, 2155, 3180, 1646, 1136, 4722, 1653, 2169, 2170, 2682, 2171, 640, 2176, 131, 1678, 2702, 2703, 3727, 4758, 1177, 4768, 2210, 2213, 3759, 1739, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 4313, 4314, 3803, 3805, 3812, 3303, 748, 2798, 1783, 4859, 3842, 1795, 1808, 3862, 3869, 290, 3365, 807, 4905, 1323, 4916, 309, 311, 2875, 4426, 2891, 4430, 1370, 1888, 1890, 873, 1388, 3952, 889, 4474, 3451, 892, 4990, 3970, 387, 3460, 1931, 401, 1432, 4014, 2483, 2995, 442, 4539, 1985, 3524, 4549, 1990, 967, 5065, 971, 2507, 981, 5077, 3544, 3040, 2018, 492, 4078, 5106, 2039, 5117}",118,"['China', 'Swedish', 'Marie Fredriksson', 'Per Gessle', '1986', 'the late 1980s', '1991', 'nineteen UK', 'US', 'US', 'The Look', 'Listen to Your Heart', 'It Must Have Been Love""', 'Pretty Woman', 'Joyride', 'Dressed for Success', 'Fading Like a Flower""', 'Fredriksson', 'Gessle', 'Sweden', 'Gyllene Tider', 'Neverending Love', 'Sweden', 'Chorus', '1999', 'Room Service', '2001', 'Europe', 'Latin America', '2002', 'Fredriksson', 'Gyllene Tider', 'Roxette', 'eight years', '2009', ""Gessle's"", 'European Party Crasher', '2011', 'Charm School', 'ten years', '2012', 'Good Karma', '2016', 'It Must Have Been Love', 'Listen to Your Heart', 'Germany', 'US', 'UK', 'Sweden', 'ABBA']","['GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON']"

479,1985,September,11,"Sri Lanka score their 1st Test Cricket victory, by 149 runs v India",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Test_cricket_records,"Test cricket is played between international cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Unlike One Day Internationals, Test matches consist of two innings per team, with no limit in the number of overs. Test cricket is first-class cricket, so statistics and records set in Test matches are also counted toward first-class records. The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from three days to timeless matches. The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877; since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 13 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased partly because of the increase in the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.Cricket is, by its nature, capable of generating large numbers of records and statistics. This list details the most significant team and individual records in Test cricket.
As of January 2020, the most successful team in Test cricket, in terms of both wins and win percentage, is Australia, having won 393 of their 830 Tests (47.34%). Excluding teams who have only played a single Test (the ICC World XI, a rest of world team who played a single Test against Australia in 2005, and recent Test newcomers Ireland and Afghanistan) the least successful team are Bangladesh who have struggled since their introduction to Test cricket in 2000, leading to questioning of their Test status.Australian Donald Bradman, widely considered the greatest batsman of all time, holds several personal and partnership records. He scored the most runs in a series, has the most double centuries and was a part of the record 5th wicket partnership. His most significant record is his batting average of 99.94. One of cricket's most famous statistics, it stands almost 40 runs higher than any other batsman's average. Don Bradman is the only player in the world to have scored 5000 runs against a single opposition: 5028 runs against England.In the Manchester Test of 1956, England spin bowler Jim Laker took 19 wickets for 90 runs (19–90) which set not only the Test record for best match figures but also the first-class one. In taking 10–53 in the second innings he became the first bowler to capture all ten wickets in a Test match innings, and his analysis remains the best innings figures. Indian leg spinner Anil Kumble is the only other bowler to have taken 10 wickets in an innings, claiming 10–74 against Pakistan in 1999. West Indies batsman Brian Lara has the highest individual score in Test cricket: he scored 400 not out against England in 2004 to surpass the innings of 380 by Matthew Hayden six months earlier. Lara had held the record before Hayden, with a score of 375 against England 10 years earlier. Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq holds the record of the fastest Test half century, scoring 50 runs from 21 balls. The record for the fastest Test century is held by New Zealand's Brendon McCullum, who scored 100 runs from 54 balls in his final Test match.
The trend of countries to increase the number of Test matches they play means that the aggregate lists are dominated by modern players. Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan became the highest Test wicket-taker in December 2007, when he passed Shane Warne's total of 708 wickets. Within a year, the equivalent batting record of highest run-scorer had also changed hands: Sachin Tendulkar surpassed the tally of 11,953 runs by Brian Lara. The record for most dismissals by a wicket-keeper is held by Mark Boucher of South Africa while the record for most catches by a fielder is held by Rahul Dravid.",{4741},1,"['Sri Lanka', 'India', 'the International Cricket Council (ICC', 'One Day', 'Test', 'five days', 'three days', 'England', 'Australia', 'March 1877', 'January 2020', 'Australia', '47.34%', 'the ICC World XI', 'Australia', '2005', 'Test', 'Ireland', 'Afghanistan', 'Bangladesh', '2000', 'Australian', 'Donald Bradman', 'centuries', 'Don Bradman', 'England', 'the Manchester Test', '1956', 'England', 'Jim Laker', 'Indian', 'Anil Kumble', 'Pakistan', '1999', 'West Indies', 'Brian Lara', 'England', '2004', 'Matthew Hayden', 'six months earlier', 'Lara', 'Hayden', 'England', '10 years earlier', 'Pakistan', 'Misbah-ul-Haq', 'half century', ""New Zealand's"", 'Brendon McCullum', 'Sri Lankan', 'Muttiah Muralitharan', 'December 2007', ""Shane Warne's"", 'a year', 'Sachin Tendulkar', 'Brian Lara', 'Mark Boucher', 'South Africa', 'Rahul Dravid']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERCENT', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON']"

From 1986 until his retirement in 2005, Kasparov was ranked world No. 1 for 225 out of 228 months and 255 months overall for his career. His peak rating of 2851, achieved in 1999, was the highest recorded until being surpassed by Magnus Carlsen in 2013. Kasparov also holds records for consecutive professional tournament victories (15) and Chess Oscars (11).
Kasparov became the youngest ever undisputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at age 22 by defeating then-champion Anatoly Karpov. He held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when a dispute with FIDE led him to set up a rival organization, the Professional Chess Association. In 1996 he became the first world champion to lose a match to a computer under standard time controls, when he lost to the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in a highly publicized match. He continued to hold the ""Classical"" World Chess Championship until his defeat by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. In spite of losing the title, he continued winning tournaments and was the world's highest-rated player when he retired from professional chess in 2005.
After Kasparov retired, he devoted his time to politics and writing. He formed the United Civil Front movement, and joined as a member of The Other Russia, a coalition opposing the administration and policies of Vladimir Putin. In 2008, he announced an intention to run as a candidate in that year's Russian presidential race, but failure to find a sufficiently large rental space to assemble the number of supporters that is legally required to endorse such a candidacy led him to withdraw. Kasparov blamed ""official obstruction"" for the lack of available space. He is widely regarded in the West as a symbol of opposition to Putin, and he was barred from the presidential ballot as the political climate in Russia makes it difficult for opposition candidates to organize.Kasparov is currently chairman for the Human Rights Foundation and chairs its International Council. In 2017, he founded the Renew Democracy Initiative (RDI), an American political organization promoting and defending liberal democracy in the U.S. and abroad. He also serves as chairman of the group.","{4224, 1378}",2,"['Garry Kasparov', 'Russian', 'Anatoly Karpov', 'Garry Kimovich Kasparov', 'Russian', 'Каспа́ров', 'Russian', 'Garik Kimovich Weinstein', 'April 1963', 'Russian', '1986', '2005', 'Kasparov', '228 months', '255 months', '2851', '1999', 'Magnus Carlsen', '2013', 'Kasparov', 'Chess Oscars', 'Kasparov', 'World Chess Champion', '1985', 'age 22', 'Anatoly Karpov', '1993', 'FIDE', 'the Professional Chess Association', '1996', 'IBM', 'Deep Blue', 'World Chess Championship', 'Vladimir Kramnik', '2000', '2005', 'Kasparov', 'the United Civil Front', 'The Other', 'Russia', 'Vladimir Putin', '2008', 'year', 'Russian', 'Kasparov', 'West', 'Putin', 'Russia', 'Kasparov', 'the Human Rights Foundation', 'International Council', '2017', 'the Renew Democracy Initiative', 'American', 'U.S.']","['PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'GPE']"

486,1986,February,15,Ferdinand Marcos wins rigged presidential election in the Philippines,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency,"The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States, tasked with gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT). As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States.
Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which is a domestic security service, the CIA has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering, with only limited domestic intelligence collection. Though it is not the only agency of the federal government of the United States specializing in HUMINT, the CIA serves as the national manager for coordination of HUMINT activities across the U.S. intelligence community. Moreover, the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President. It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions, such as the Special Activities Center. The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries, such as Germany's BND.
Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the CIA Director concurrently served as the head of the Intelligence Community; today, the CIA is organized under the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).

487,1986,April,26,"World's worst nuclear disaster: 4th reactor at Chernobyl nuclear power station in USSR explodes, 31 die, radioactive contamination reaches much of Western Europe",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster,"The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on Saturday 26 April 1986, at the No. 4 nuclear reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR. It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history and is one of only two nuclear energy disasters rated at seven—the maximum severity—on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan.
The accident started during a safety test on an RBMK-type nuclear reactor, which was commonly used throughout the Soviet Union. The test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to aid the development of a safety procedure for maintaining reactor cooling water circulation until the back-up electrical generators could provide power. This gap was about one minute and had been identified as a potential safety problem that could cause the nuclear reactor core to overheat. It was hoped to prove that the residual rotational energy in a turbine generator could provide enough power to cover the gap. Three such tests had been conducted since 1982, but they had failed to provide a solution. On this fourth attempt, an unexpected 10-hour delay meant that an unprepared operating shift was on duty. During the planned decrease of reactor power in preparation for the electrical test, the power unexpectedly dropped to a near-zero level. The operators were able to only partially restore the specified test power, which put the reactor in a potentially unstable condition. This risk was not made evident in the operating instructions, so the operators proceeded with the electrical test. Upon test completion, the operators triggered a reactor shutdown, but a combination of unstable conditions and reactor design flaws caused an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction instead.A large amount of energy was suddenly released, vapourising superheated cooling water and rupturing the reactor core in a highly destructive steam explosion. This was immediately followed by an open-air reactor core fire that released considerable airborne radioactive contamination for about nine days that precipitated onto parts of the USSR and western Europe, before being finally contained on 4 May 1986. The fire gradually released about the same amount of contamination as the initial explosion. 
As a result of rising ambient radiation levels off-site, a 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident. About 49,000 people were evacuated from the area, primarily from Pripyat. The exclusion zone was later increased to 30 kilometres (19 mi) radius when a further 68,000 people were evacuated from the wider area.The reactor explosion killed two of the reactor operating staff. In the emergency response that followed, 134 station staff and firemen were hospitalized with acute radiation syndrome due to absorbing high doses of ionizing radiation. Of these 134 people, 28 died in the days to months afterward and approximately 14 suspected radiation-induced cancer deaths followed within the next 10 years. Among the wider population, an excess of 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were documented as of 2011. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) has, at multiple times, reviewed all the published research on the incident and found that at present, fewer than 100 documented deaths are likely to be attributable to increased exposure to radiation. Determining the total eventual number of exposure related deaths is uncertain based on the linear no-threshold model, a contested statistical model, which has also been used in estimates of low level radon and air pollution exposure. Model predictions with the greatest confidence values of the eventual total death toll in the decades ahead from Chernobyl releases vary, from 4,000 fatalities when solely assessing the three most contaminated former Soviet states, to about 9,000 to 16,000 fatalities when assessing the total continent of Europe.To reduce the spread of radioactive contamination from the wreckage and protect it from weathering, the protective Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus was built by December 1986. It also provided radiological protection for the crews of the undamaged reactors at the site, which continued operating. Due to the continued deterioration of the sarcophagus, it was further enclosed in 2017 by the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement, a larger enclosure that allows the removal of both the sarcophagus and the reactor debris, while containing the radioactive hazard. Nuclear clean-up is scheduled for completion in 2065. The Chernobyl disaster is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, both in terms of cost and casualties. The initial emergency response, together with later decontamination of the environment, ultimately involved more than 500,000 personnel and cost an estimated 18 billion Soviet rubles—roughly US$68 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation. The accident resulted in safety upgrades on all remaining Soviet-designed RBMK reactors, of which 10 continue to be operational as of 2019.","{2564, 1029, 7, 2568, 1555, 2587, 2079, 1058, 1584, 1590, 2104, 1595, 576, 2112, 2119, 589, 1622, 2141, 2152, 3693, 1646, 3699, 2171, 640, 3722, 1167, 1168, 2191, 3727, 4756, 2718, 2210, 1192, 1706, 3243, 1709, 174, 3777, 1732, 3272, 3795, 4307, 1757, 3813, 748, 3322, 1789, 4879, 4372, 1813, 4895, 2336, 1832, 4910, 310, 1350, 843, 1867, 2379, 2891, 4940, 2388, 2901, 3413, 4445, 2910, 1888, 865, 3431, 4971, 2924, 3443, 889, 890, 3451, 892, 4993, 4994, 1924, 2955, 3979, 1424, 2962, 3476, 3482, 2475, 3500, 4536, 1979, 3008, 452, 964, 2503, 4051, 2004, 5077, 1502, 3046, 3560, 2026, 4074, 4589, 1526, 3578, 4605}",105,"['World', 'Chernobyl', 'USSR', '31', 'Western Europe', 'Chernobyl', 'Saturday 26 April 1986', 'the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant', 'Pripyat', 'the Ukrainian SSR', 'the International Nuclear Event Scale', 'Fukushima Daiichi', 'Japan', 'RBMK', 'the Soviet Union', '1982', 'about nine days', 'USSR', 'Europe', '4 May 1986', 'Pripyat', 'the days to months', 'the next 10 years', '2011', 'The United Nations Scientific Committee', 'UNSCEAR', 'the decades ahead', 'Chernobyl', 'Soviet', 'Europe', 'Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant', 'December 1986', '2017', 'the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement', '2065', 'Chernobyl', '2019', 'Soviet', 'RBMK', '2019']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE']"
488,1986,September,8,"""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" is first broadcast nationally",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show,"The Oprah Winfrey Show, often referred to as The Oprah Show or simply Oprah, is an American daytime syndicated talk show that aired nationally for 25 seasons from September 8, 1986, to May 25, 2011, in Chicago, Illinois. Produced and hosted by its namesake, Oprah Winfrey, it remains one of the highest-rated daytime talk shows in American television history.The show was highly influential to many young stars, and many of its themes have penetrated into the American pop-cultural consciousness. Winfrey used the show as an educational platform, featuring book clubs, interviews, self-improvement segments, and philanthropic forays into world events. The show did not attempt to profit off the products it endorses; it had no licensing agreement with retailers when products were promoted, nor did the show make any money from endorsing books for its book club.Oprah had its roots in A.M. Chicago, a half-hour morning talk show airing on WLS-TV, an ABC owned-and-operated station in Chicago. Winfrey took over as host on January 2, 1984, and, within a month, took it from last place to first place in local Chicago ratings. Following Winfrey's success in—and Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for-her performance as Sofia in the film  The Color Purple, on September 8, 1986, the talk show was relaunched under its current title and picked up nationally. For the premiere, the show's producers tried rigorously to book Miami Vice's Don Johnson as the first guest, even trying to bribe him with Dom Pérignon and a pair of rhinestone sunglasses. All attempts to book Johnson failed and Winfrey decided to ""do what we do best, and that is a show about and with everyday people"". The theme for the premiere show was ""How to Marry the Man or Woman of Your Choice"".Oprah was one of the longest-running daytime television talk shows in history. The show received 47 Daytime Emmy Awards before Winfrey chose to stop submitting it for consideration in 2000. In 2002, TV Guide ranked it at #49 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2013, they ranked it as the 19th greatest TV show of all time.In November 2009, Winfrey announced that the show would conclude in 2011 following its 25th and final season.

490,1986,October,11,"Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev open talks at a summit in Reykjavik, Iceland",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland,"Ireland ( (listen); Irish: Éire [ˈeːɾʲə] (listen); Ulster-Scots: Airlann [ˈɑːrlən]) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.Geopolitically, Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), which covers five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. In 2011, the population of Ireland was about 6.6 million, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain. As of 2016, 4.8 million live in the Republic of Ireland, and 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland.The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages. Today, woodland makes up about 10% of the island, compared with a European average of over 33%, and most of it is non-native conifer plantations. There are twenty-six extant land mammal species native to Ireland. The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate, and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.
The earliest evidence of human presence in Ireland is dated at 10,500 BC. Gaelic Ireland had emerged by the 1st century AD. The island was Christianised from the 5th century onward. Following the 12th century Norman invasion, England claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th–17th century Tudor conquest, which led to colonisation by settlers from Britain. In the 1690s, a system of Protestant English rule was designed to materially disadvantage the Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters, and was extended during the 18th century. With the Acts of Union in 1801, Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom. A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition of the island, creating the Irish Free State, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s. This subsided following a political agreement in 1998. In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the European Economic Community while the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, as part of it, did the same.
Irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of literature. Alongside mainstream Western culture, a strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed through Gaelic games, Irish music and the Irish language. The island's culture shares many features with that of Great Britain, including the English language, and sports such as association football, rugby, horse racing, and golf.","{1031, 7, 2058, 524, 1038, 1041, 4113, 2579, 2069, 4633, 1562, 28, 3612, 33, 1058, 4643, 550, 1066, 1583, 2615, 2104, 4154, 576, 1089, 1602, 580, 70, 2119, 3656, 3154, 2131, 1109, 2645, 2647, 2137, 2649, 603, 3676, 1633, 3682, 100, 4716, 4722, 2169, 3199, 1153, 1668, 1162, 1178, 3228, 1183, 4255, 1185, 2721, 4774, 1192, 1193, 3243, 2221, 174, 176, 4785, 698, 703, 2241, 2245, 198, 2763, 1740, 4307, 2261, 1240, 4829, 1251, 3299, 1765, 3811, 743, 4324, 2793, 4330, 3833, 3322, 3834, 767, 257, 3842, 4868, 4871, 1288, 1802, 1804, 269, 4879, 273, 1299, 3864, 287, 3874, 2339, 1830, 815, 2865, 2874, 2878, 1343, 1346, 2372, 2884, 843, 2891, 4940, 4430, 2388, 2901, 3413, 1888, 2916, 4971, 1388, 3437, 2415, 885, 1397, 375, 4472, 889, 3451, 893, 4477, 4480, 3459, 900, 1925, 4487, 2955, 5003, 3989, 3489, 418, 423, 1960, 2475, 4017, 4020, 4024, 4536, 442, 1466, 1979, 1471, 4547, 452, 2509, 2514, 4563, 471, 987, 3036, 1502, 3553, 1508, 2026, 4589, 3061, 1015, 504, 3578, 4605, 1022}",170,"['Ronald Reagan', 'Mikhail Gorbachev', 'Reykjavik', 'Iceland', 'Ireland', 'Irish', 'Ulster-Scots: Airlann', 'the North Atlantic', 'Great Britain', 'the North Channel', 'the Irish Sea', ""St George's"", 'Ireland', 'the British Isles', 'Europe', 'Earth', 'Ireland', 'the Republic of Ireland', 'Ireland', 'Northern Ireland', 'the United Kingdom', '2011', 'Ireland', 'Europe', 'Great Britain', '2016', 'the Republic of Ireland', 'Northern Ireland', 'Ireland', 'Ireland', 'Today', 'about 10%', 'European', 'over 33%', 'Ireland', 'Irish', 'the Atlantic Ocean', 'winters', 'Europe', 'Ireland', 'BC', 'Gaelic Ireland', 'the 1st century AD', '5th century', 'the 12th century', 'Norman', 'England', 'English', 'the 16th–17th century', 'Tudor', 'Britain', 'the 1690s', 'English', 'Catholic', 'the 18th century', '1801', 'Ireland', 'the United Kingdom', 'the early 20th century', 'Irish', 'the following decades', 'Northern Ireland', 'the United Kingdom', 'Northern Ireland', 'the late 1960s', 'the 1990s', '1998', '1973', 'the Republic of Ireland', 'the European Economic Community', 'the United Kingdom', 'Northern Ireland', 'Irish', 'Irish', 'Irish', 'Great Britain', 'English']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'NORP', 'PERCENT', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'LANGUAGE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LANGUAGE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'LANGUAGE']"

In 1947, Iran was among 13 countries that voted against the UN Partition Plan for Palestine.  Two years later, Iran also voted against Israel's admission to the United Nations.
Nevertheless, Iran was the second Muslim-majority country to recognize Israel as a sovereign state after Turkey. After the 1953 coup d'état, which re-installed pro-Western Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to power, relations between the two countries significantly improved.After the 1979 Revolution, Iran severed all diplomatic and commercial ties with Israel, and its Islamic government does not recognize the legitimacy of Israel as a state. The turn from cold peace to hostility started in the early 1990s, shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union and defeat of the Iraqi Army during Desert Storm, after which relative power in the Middle East shifted towards Iran and Israel. The conflict escalated in the early 1990s, as Yitzhak Rabin's government adopted a more aggressive posture on Iran.

495,1986,January,23,"1st induction of Rock 'N' Roll Hall of Fame (Chuck Berry, James Brown, Ray Charles, Domino, Everly Bros, Buddy Holly, J L Lewis & Elvis Presley)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown,"James Joseph Brown (May 3, 1933 – December 25, 2006) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, musician, record producer and bandleader. A progenitor of funk music and a major figure of 20th century music and dance, he is often referred to as the ""Godfather of Soul"" and ""Soul Brother No. 1"". In a career that lasted over 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres.Brown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He joined a rhythm and blues vocal group, the Gospel Starlighters (which later evolved into the Famous Flames) founded by Bobby Byrd, in which he was the lead singer. First coming to national public attention in the late 1950s as a member of the singing group The Famous Flames with the hit ballads ""Please, Please, Please"" and ""Try Me"", Brown built a reputation as a tireless live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album Live at the Apollo and hit singles such as ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"", ""I Got You (I Feel Good)"" and ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World"".
During the late 1960s, Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly ""Africanized"" approach to music-making that influenced the development of funk music. By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation of the J.B.s with records such as ""Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine"" and ""The Payback"". He also became noted for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit ""Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud"". Brown continued to perform and record until his death from pneumonia in 2006. 
Brown recorded 17 singles that reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B charts. He also holds the record for the most singles listed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart which did not reach No. 1. Brown was inducted into 1st class of the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013 as an artist and then in 2017 as a songwriter. He also received honors from many other institutions, including inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. In Joel Whitburn's analysis of the Billboard R&B charts from 1942 to 2010, Brown is ranked No. 1 in The Top 500 Artists. He is ranked No. 7 on Rolling Stone's list of its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Rolling Stone has also cited Brown as the most sampled artist of all time.","{1025, 1538, 4611, 2051, 7, 2568, 3597, 3091, 536, 3098, 3613, 4134, 1576, 563, 2122, 4682, 1616, 595, 4691, 1622, 2141, 3174, 3686, 620, 1133, 1646, 3180, 1136, 1649, 2169, 2170, 3195, 635, 2682, 2171, 127, 640, 4235, 1678, 2702, 2703, 3727, 1177, 4768, 2210, 677, 690, 694, 1739, 4815, 3795, 4307, 213, 4825, 2267, 3803, 3812, 744, 748, 3322, 1275, 3842, 1795, 3862, 4895, 290, 1828, 1319, 4905, 1834, 3886, 4400, 311, 1847, 4407, 826, 2875, 4413, 4426, 4430, 4445, 1888, 1890, 873, 4971, 1388, 4981, 889, 4474, 3451, 892, 4990, 4993, 3970, 387, 903, 2955, 3979, 1938, 4498, 3989, 1432, 3483, 5019, 3489, 4007, 936, 1454, 2483, 4024, 4536, 4539, 961, 3524, 4549, 1990, 967, 971, 1483, 2507, 4561, 5074, 467, 4051, 5077, 3034, 1502, 2018, 4589, 2039}",130,"[""Rock 'N' Roll Hall of Fame"", 'Chuck Berry', 'James Brown', 'Ray Charles', 'Domino', 'Everly Bros', 'J L Lewis & Elvis Presley', 'James Joseph Brown', 'May 3, 1933 – December 25, 2006', 'American', '20th century', 'Godfather of Soul', 'Soul Brother', '50 years', 'Brown', 'Toccoa', 'Georgia', 'the Gospel Starlighters', 'the Famous Flames', 'Bobby Byrd', 'the late 1950s', 'The Famous Flames', 'Please, Please, Please', 'Try Me', 'Brown', 'the James Brown Band', 'James Brown Orchestra', 'the 1960s', 'Apollo', ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"", 'I Got You', 'the late 1960s', 'Brown', 'Africanized', 'the early 1970s', 'Brown', 'Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine', 'The Payback', '1968', 'Say It Loud', 'Brown', '2006', 'Brown', 'Billboard R&B', 'Billboard Hot 100', 'Brown', 'the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame', '2013', '2017', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame', ""Joel Whitburn's"", 'Billboard R&B', '1942 to 2010', 'Brown', ""Rolling Stone's"", 'Rolling Stone', 'Brown']","['ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON']"

503,1987,January,6,Astronomers at University of California see 1st sight of birth of a galaxy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet,"Halley's Comet or Comet Halley, officially designated 1P/Halley, is a short-period comet visible from Earth every 75–76 years. Halley is the only known short-period comet that is regularly visible to the naked eye from Earth, and the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime.  Halley last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061 to 2062.Halley's returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BC. Clear records of the comet's appearances were made by Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European chroniclers, but, at those times, were not recognized as reappearances of the same object. The comet's periodicity was first determined in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley, after whom it is now named.
During its 1986 apparition, Halley's Comet became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation. These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple's ""dirty snowball"" model, which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices—such as water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia—and dust. The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy.","{3332, 4235, 1783, 3864, 5019, 1824, 290, 3365, 2171, 2092, 4140, 1455, 565, 442, 5052, 4413, 704, 4545, 2884, 2507, 2763, 1742, 3154, 4307, 2261, 4056, 603, 1888, 612, 4971, 375, 1403}",32,"['University of California', 'Halley', 'Comet', 'Comet Halley', 'Earth', 'Halley', 'Earth', 'Halley', '1986', 'mid-2061', 'Solar System', 'Chinese', 'Babylonian', 'European', '1705', 'English', 'Edmond Halley', '1986', 'Halley', 'Comet', 'Fred Whipple', 'Halley', 'Halley']","['ORG', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON']"

Nuclear-free zones usually neither address nor prohibit radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine even though many of them are produced in nuclear reactors. They typically do not prohibit other nuclear technologies such as cyclotrons used in particle physics.
Several sub-national authorities worldwide have declared themselves ""nuclear-free"". However, the label is often symbolic, as nuclear policy is usually determined and regulated at higher levels of government: nuclear weapons and components may traverse nuclear-free zones via military transport without the knowledge or consent of local authorities which had declared nuclear-free zones.
Palau became the first nuclear-free nation in 1980.

505,1987,June,11,Margaret Thatcher is 1st British Prime Minister in 160 years to win a third consecutive term,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher,"Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher,  (née Roberts; 13 October 1925 – 8 April 2013) was a British stateswoman who served as prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990. She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to hold that office. A Soviet journalist dubbed her ""The Iron Lady"", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies known as Thatcherism.
Thatcher studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, and worked briefly as a research chemist, before becoming a barrister. She was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her secretary of state for education and science in his 1970–74 government. In 1975, she defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become leader of the Opposition, the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. On becoming prime minister after winning the 1979 general election, Thatcher introduced a series of economic policies intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Her popularity in her first years in office waned amid recession and rising unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her landslide re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt by the Provisional IRA in the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing and achieved a political victory against the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1984–85 miners' strike.
Thatcher was re-elected for a third term with another landslide in 1987, but her subsequent support for the Community Charge (""poll tax"") was widely unpopular, and her increasingly Eurosceptic views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as prime minister and party leader in November 1990, after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership (characterised by journalist Simon Heffer as ""a rare coup d’état at the top of the British politics: the first since Lloyd George sawed Asquith off at the knees in 1916"").
After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher (of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. In 2013, she died of a stroke at the Ritz Hotel in London, at the age of 87.
Although a controversial figure in British political culture, Thatcher is nonetheless viewed favourably in historical rankings of British prime ministers. Her tenure constituted a realignment towards neoliberal policies in the United Kingdom and debate over the complicated legacy of Thatcherism persists into the 21st century.","{4097, 7, 524, 3090, 4633, 1566, 34, 1058, 4642, 1576, 1584, 4661, 2102, 2104, 2112, 580, 1095, 1622, 2649, 2152, 4716, 1136, 2171, 127, 640, 4235, 3727, 1170, 666, 4768, 1185, 2210, 2721, 3243, 1709, 174, 176, 4785, 2740, 698, 703, 3777, 3795, 4307, 4825, 4829, 3813, 4330, 4845, 3322, 3842, 4895, 3874, 2339, 4899, 3365, 4905, 1835, 815, 4923, 4413, 2379, 2891, 2388, 3413, 1888, 1890, 4967, 4971, 1905, 4472, 889, 892, 4993, 4994, 3459, 900, 3978, 2955, 3979, 4526, 2483, 4536, 1465, 1979, 452, 964, 3524, 2508, 4561, 4051, 2004, 4563, 5077, 2525, 1502, 2039, 3578, 4605}",99,"['Margaret Thatcher', 'British', '160 years', 'Margaret Hilda Thatcher', 'Baroness Thatcher', 'Roberts', '13 October 1925', 'April 2013', 'British', 'the United Kingdom', '1979 to 1990', 'the Conservative Party', '1975 to 1990', 'British', 'the 20th century', 'Soviet', 'The Iron Lady', 'Thatcher', 'Somerville College', 'Oxford', 'Parliament', 'Finchley', '1959', 'Edward Heath', '1975', 'Conservative Party', 'Opposition', 'the United Kingdom', '1979', 'Thatcher', 'Britain', 'the Winter of Discontent', 'her first years', '1982', 'Falklands War', '1983', 'the Provisional IRA', '1984', 'Brighton', 'the National Union of Mineworkers', 'Thatcher', '1987', 'Eurosceptic', 'the European Community', 'Cabinet', 'November 1990', 'Michael Heseltine', 'Simon Heffer', 'British', 'Lloyd George', '1916', 'Commons', '1992', 'Thatcher', 'Kesteven', 'the County of Lincolnshire', 'the House of Lords', '2013', 'the Ritz Hotel', 'London', 'the age of 87', 'British', 'Thatcher', 'British', 'the United Kingdom', 'the 21st century']","['PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE']"
506,1987,October,19,"Black Monday: Stock markets around the world crash, including the Dow Jones stock index, which falls 508.32 points (22%), 4½ times the previous daily record",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_crash,"A stock market crash is a sudden dramatic decline of stock prices across a significant cross-section of a stock market, resulting in a significant loss of paper wealth. Crashes are driven by panic as much as by underlying economic factors. They often follow speculation and economic bubbles. 
A stock market crash is a social phenomenon where external economic events combine with crowd psychology in a positive feedback loop where selling by some market participants drives more market participants to sell. Generally speaking, crashes usually occur under the following conditions: a prolonged period of rising stock prices and excessive economic optimism, a market where price–earnings ratios exceed long-term averages, and extensive use of margin debt and leverage by market participants. Other aspects such as wars, large-corporation hacks, changes in federal laws and regulations, and natural disasters of highly economically productive areas may also influence a significant decline in the stock market value of a wide range of stocks. All such stock drops may result in the rise of stock prices for corporations competing against the affected corporations.There is no numerically specific definition of a stock market crash but the term commonly applies to steep double-digit percentage losses in a stock market index over a period of several days. Crashes are often distinguished from bear markets by panic selling and abrupt, dramatic price declines. Bear markets are periods of declining stock market prices that are measured in months or years. Crashes are often associated with bear  markets, however, they do not necessarily go hand in hand. Black Monday (1987), for example, did not lead to a bear market. Likewise, the Japanese bear market of the 1990s occurred over several years without any notable crashes.
Crashes are generally unexpected. As Niall Ferguson stated, ""Before the crash, our world seems almost stationary, deceptively so, balanced, at a set point. So that when the crash finally hits — as inevitably it will — everyone seems surprised. And our brains keep telling us it’s not time for a crash.""","{4611, 2051, 1540, 4101, 1036, 3598, 3601, 1555, 1566, 1569, 1058, 4642, 3109, 3110, 4134, 4138, 1583, 1584, 2096, 4661, 2104, 2112, 2122, 4682, 4174, 4688, 1109, 1622, 2647, 3676, 2141, 606, 607, 1633, 4199, 2152, 106, 620, 2157, 1646, 2159, 1136, 1649, 1651, 2679, 3705, 2169, 2682, 3199, 640, 1153, 127, 1162, 3722, 3724, 4235, 1678, 2703, 3727, 1683, 1177, 2713, 4768, 1185, 2210, 680, 1192, 1193, 3243, 1710, 3252, 698, 4286, 4287, 4799, 3777, 1730, 1732, 2760, 3272, 1739, 3795, 4307, 3799, 3803, 1757, 1248, 1251, 3812, 3813, 2278, 3303, 2793, 234, 2794, 748, 239, 1780, 757, 762, 3326, 1288, 1291, 1803, 1294, 3862, 795, 4895, 290, 1832, 4905, 810, 812, 302, 3886, 310, 1334, 2875, 4413, 2368, 327, 4426, 843, 2379, 2891, 4430, 847, 4942, 1873, 2899, 2388, 2901, 3413, 3927, 2908, 4445, 1888, 3936, 1890, 870, 873, 1386, 3434, 1388, 4971, 2415, 1907, 4474, 3451, 892, 4993, 4994, 387, 2435, 1418, 3979, 1424, 4496, 2964, 3989, 3481, 3482, 3994, 3489, 418, 2984, 3500, 3501, 4526, 5037, 2483, 4024, 4539, 5052, 5059, 452, 453, 964, 967, 3524, 4549, 971, 2507, 1486, 4561, 4051, 2004, 5077, 990, 1508, 2026, 4074, 4589, 495, 1008, 5107, 1526, 2039, 3581}",199,"['Black Monday', 'Dow Jones', '22%', 'daily', 'several days', 'months', 'years', 'Crashes', 'Black Monday', 'Japanese', 'the 1990s', 'several years', 'Niall Ferguson']","['EVENT', 'ORG', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON']"

It was developed by Philips in Hasselt, Belgium, and introduced in September 1963. Compact Cassettes come in two forms, either already containing content as a prerecorded cassette (Musicassette), or as a fully recordable ""blank"" cassette. Both forms are reversible by the user.The compact cassette technology was originally designed for dictation machines, but improvements in fidelity led the Compact Cassette to supplant the stereo 8-track cartridge and reel-to-reel tape recording in most non-professional applications. Its uses ranged from portable audio to home recording to data storage for early microcomputers. The first cassette player (although mono) designed for use in car dashboards was introduced in 1968. Between the early 1970s and continuing through the 1990s, the cassette was one of the two most common formats for prerecorded music, first alongside the LP record and later the compact disc (CD).Compact Cassettes contain two miniature spools, between which the magnetically coated, polyester-type plastic film (magnetic tape) is passed and wound. These spools and their attendant parts are held inside a protective plastic shell which is 4 by 2.5 by 0.5 inches (10 cm × 6.3 cm × 1.3 cm) at its largest dimensions. The tape itself is commonly referred to as ""eighth-inch"" tape, supposedly 1⁄8 inch (3.17 mm) wide, but it is slightly larger: 0.15 inches (3.81 mm). Two stereo pairs of tracks (four total) or two monaural audio tracks are available on the tape; one stereo pair or one monophonic track is played or recorded when the tape is moving in one direction and the second (pair) when moving in the other direction. This reversal is achieved either by flipping the cassette, or by the reversal of tape movement (""auto-reverse"") when the mechanism detects that the tape has come to an end.",set(),0,"['North American Philips Company', 'Hasselt', 'Belgium', 'September 1963', 'Compact Cassettes', 'Musicassette', '1968', 'Between the early 1970s', 'the 1990s', 'LP', 'Cassettes']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'ORG']"

Franklin began her career as a child singing gospel at New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan, where her father C. L. Franklin was minister. At the age of 18, she embarked on a secular-music career as a recording artist for Columbia Records. While Franklin's career did not immediately flourish, she found acclaim and commercial success after signing with Atlantic Records in 1966. Hit songs such as ""Respect"", ""Chain of Fools"", ""Think"", ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"", ""I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)"", and ""I Say a Little Prayer"", propelled her past her musical peers. By the end of the 1960s, Aretha Franklin had come to be known as the ""Queen of Soul"".
Franklin continued to record acclaimed albums such as I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Lady Soul (1968), Spirit in the Dark (1970), Young, Gifted and Black (1972), Amazing Grace (1972), and Sparkle (1976) before experiencing problems with her record company. Franklin left Atlantic in 1979 and signed with Arista Records. She appeared in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers before releasing the successful albums Jump to It (1982), Who's Zoomin' Who? (1985), and Aretha (1986) on the Arista label.  In 1998, Franklin returned to the Top 40 with the Lauryn Hill-produced song ""A Rose Is Still a Rose""; later, she released an album of the same name which was certified gold. That same year, Franklin earned international acclaim for her performance of ""Nessun dorma"" at the Grammy Awards; she filled in at the last minute for Luciano Pavarotti, who canceled his appearance after the show had already begun. In a widely noted performance, she paid tribute to 2015 honoree Carole King by singing ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"" at the Kennedy Center Honors.
Franklin recorded 112 charted singles on Billboard, including 77 Hot 100 entries, 17 top-ten pop singles, 100 R&B entries, and 20 number-one R&B singles. Franklin's well-known hits include ""Rock Steady"", ""Call Me"", ""Ain't No Way"", ""Don't Play That Song (You Lied)"", ""Spanish Harlem"", ""Day Dreaming"", ""Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)"", ""Something He Can Feel"", ""Jump to It"", ""Freeway of Love"", ""Who's Zoomin' Who"", and ""I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)"" (a duet with George Michael). She won 18 Grammy Awards, including the first eight awards given for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance (1968–1975). Franklin is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide.Franklin received numerous honors throughout her career. She was awarded the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1987, she became the first female performer to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She also was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2012. In 2010, Rolling Stone magazine ranked her number one on its list of the ""100 Greatest Singers of All Time"" and number nine on its list of ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"".

512,1987,August,22,"Madonna's ""Who's That Girl"" single goes #1",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%27s_That_Girl_(Madonna_song),"""Who's That Girl"" is a song by American singer Madonna from the soundtrack album of the 1987 film, Who's That Girl. It was released on June 23, 1987, by Sire Records as the first album single. The song was later included on the two-disc edition of Madonna's 2009 greatest hits album Celebration. While shooting for the film, then called Slammer, Madonna had requested Patrick Leonard to develop an uptempo song that captured the nature of her film persona. She later added the lyrics and vocals to the demo tape developed by Leonard, and decided to rename the song as well as the film to ""Who's That Girl"".
Featuring instrumentation from drums, bass, and stringed instruments, ""Who's That Girl"" continued Madonna's fascination with Hispanic culture by incorporating Spanish lyrics and using the effect of double vocals. Critical reception was mixed to positive; some critics compared it to Madonna's previous single, ""La Isla Bonita"", while others found it forgettable. ""Who's That Girl"" became Madonna's sixth single to top the Billboard Hot 100, while peaking atop the charts in countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Netherlands, Ireland and Belgium. It was also nominated for ""Best Song From A Motion Picture"" at the 1988 Grammy Awards and ""Best Original Song"" at the 1988 Golden Globe Awards.
The music video portrayed a different persona of Madonna, rather than her film character for which it was released. Like the song, it incorporated Hispanic culture and portrayed her dressed in Spanish style as a young lady in search of a treasure. Madonna has performed the song on her Who's That Girl (1987) and Rebel Heart (2015–2016) tours. The song has been covered by many artists and has appeared in compilations and tribute albums.","{4736, 3842, 1795, 3459, 3970, 4611, 7, 2568, 2955, 524, 4879, 1275, 3348, 3989, 1432, 3613, 157, 290, 2210, 3874, 2214, 1319, 1576, 4007, 4134, 174, 4400, 4020, 1847, 4024, 4407, 826, 4536, 4920, 3519, 3520, 1990, 967, 2507, 2508, 4940, 3154, 467, 595, 2388, 982, 2262, 3451, 3666, 3927, 4307, 2525, 1502, 889, 2018, 997, 358, 4971, 748, 1133, 3436, 3951, 4589, 1783, 2169, 3322, 2171, 4605, 4990}",69,"['Madonna', 'Who\'s That Girl"" single goes #1', 'American', 'Madonna', '1987', ""Who's That Girl"", 'June 23, 1987', 'Sire Records', 'Madonna', '2009', 'Slammer', 'Madonna', 'Patrick Leonard', 'Leonard', 'Who\'s That Girl"".\r\n', ""Who's That Girl"", 'Madonna', 'Hispanic', 'Spanish', 'Madonna', 'La Isla Bonita', 'Madonna', 'Billboard Hot 100', 'the United Kingdom', 'Canada', 'Netherlands', 'Ireland', 'Belgium', '1988', 'Grammy Awards', 'Best Original Song', '1988', 'Golden Globe Awards', 'Madonna', 'Hispanic', 'Spanish', 'Madonna', '1987', 'Rebel Heart']","['PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG']"
513,1987,June,6,"French Open Women's Tennis: 17 year old German Steffi Graf beats World #1 Martina Navratilova 6-4, 4-6, 8-6; Graf's first Grand Slam victory",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf,"Stefanie Maria ""Steffi"" Graf (German pronunciation: [ˈʃtɛfiː ˈɡʁaːf]; born 14 June 1969) is a German former professional tennis player. She was ranked world No. 1 and won 22 Grand Slam singles titles. Her 22 singles titles put her second on the list of major wins in the female competition since the introduction of the Open Era in 1968 and is third all-time behind Margaret Court (24) and Serena Williams (23). In 1988, she became the only tennis player to achieve the Golden Slam by winning all four Grand Slam singles titles and the Olympic gold medal in the same calendar year. Furthermore, she is the only tennis player to have won each Grand Slam tournament at least four times.
Graf was ranked world No. 1 by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for a record 377 total weeks—the longest period for which any player, male or female, has held the number-one ranking since the WTA and the Association of Tennis Professionals began issuing rankings. She won 107 singles titles, which ranks her third on the WTA's all-time list after Martina Navratilova (167 titles) and Chris Evert (157 titles). She and Margaret Court are the only players, male or female, to win three Grand Slam tournaments in a calendar year five times (1988, 1989, 1993, 1995 and 1996).
Notable features of Graf's game were her versatility across all playing surfaces, footwork and powerful forehand drive. Graf's athletic ability and aggressive game played from the baseline have been credited with developing the modern style of play that has come to dominate today's game. She won six French Open singles titles (second to Evert), seven Wimbledon singles titles, four Australian Open titles, and five U.S. Open singles titles. She is the only singles player (male or female) to have achieved a Grand Slam since hard court was introduced as a surface at the US Open in 1987. Consequently, Graf's Grand Slam was achieved on grass, clay, and hard court while the previous five Grand Slams were decided on only grass and clay. Graf reached thirteen consecutive major singles finals, from the 1987 French Open through to the 1990 French Open, winning nine of them. She won 5 consecutive major singles tournaments (1988 Australian Open to 1989 Australian Open), and seven out of eight, in two calendar years (1988 Australian Open to 1989 US Open, except 1989 French Open). She reached a total of 31 major singles finals.
Graf retired at the age of 30 in 1999 while she was ranked world No. 3. The year of her retirement, Billie Jean King said, ""Steffi is definitely the greatest women's tennis player of all time."" In December 1999, Graf was named the greatest female tennis player of the 20th century by a panel of experts assembled by the Associated Press. She married former world No. 1 men's tennis player Andre Agassi in October 2001. They have two children. Graf was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 2004. Along with countryman Boris Becker, Graf was considered instrumental in popularizing tennis in Germany, where it has remained a highly popular sport ever since.","{1026, 1540, 528, 1041, 3601, 1562, 1563, 2591, 4642, 3109, 550, 1576, 1066, 2092, 4661, 1084, 2112, 3137, 66, 580, 2647, 3676, 3686, 4718, 3186, 1651, 2679, 2171, 3195, 3727, 1170, 1683, 663, 4255, 1193, 682, 3243, 3244, 3252, 698, 4287, 2241, 3777, 3268, 2245, 1222, 4807, 1233, 2265, 1251, 3299, 1765, 3811, 2793, 239, 762, 767, 4868, 1288, 283, 287, 4895, 1830, 4905, 810, 2355, 1334, 4407, 2875, 2878, 1346, 3908, 327, 3399, 2382, 4944, 2898, 2901, 3413, 2908, 1374, 1890, 355, 2916, 3427, 1386, 2435, 1418, 2955, 3979, 5003, 4496, 3481, 3482, 3999, 3489, 4516, 2984, 5037, 4526, 4017, 2483, 5043, 2487, 4536, 1466, 1979, 5052, 1471, 1475, 452, 3524, 2504, 2509, 463, 3542, 3034, 3046, 5097, 2039, 3578, 4605}",122,"['French', '17 year old', 'German', 'Steffi Graf', 'Martina Navratilova', 'Graf', 'Grand Slam', 'Stefanie Maria ""', 'Steffi"" Graf', 'German', '14 June 1969', 'German', 'Grand Slam', 'the Open Era', '1968', 'Margaret Court', 'Serena Williams', '1988', 'the Golden Slam', 'Grand Slam', 'Olympic', 'the same calendar year', 'Grand Slam', ""the Women's Tennis Association"", 'weeks', 'WTA', 'the Association of Tennis Professionals', 'Martina Navratilova', 'Chris Evert', 'Margaret Court', 'Grand Slam', 'year', '1988, 1989, 1993, 1995 and 1996', 'Graf', 'Graf', 'today', 'French', 'Evert', 'Wimbledon', 'Australian', 'U.S.', 'the US Open', '1987', 'Graf', 'Grand Slams', 'Graf', '1987', 'French Open', '1990', 'French Open', '(1988', 'Australian', '1989', 'Australian', 'two calendar years', 'Australian', '1989', 'US Open', '1989', 'French Open', 'the age of 30 in 1999', 'Billie Jean King', 'Steffi', 'December 1999', 'Graf', 'the 20th century', 'the Associated Press', 'Andre Agassi', 'October 2001', 'Graf', 'the Tennis Hall of Fame', '2004', 'Boris Becker', 'Graf', 'Germany']","['NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE']"

The 85th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Oakland Athletics and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers, with the Dodgers upsetting the heavily favored Athletics to win the Series in five games. It is best known for the pinch-hit walk-off home run hit by Dodgers outfielder Kirk Gibson, who could barely walk due to injuries suffered during the NL Championship Series, against Athletics closer Dennis Eckersley in Game 1. The Dodgers were the only MLB team to win more than one World Series title in the 1980s; their other World Series title during the decade came in 1981 (they also broke a 10-year streak of 10 different World Series champions going back to 1978).Although Gibson's home run has become an iconic World Series moment, it was World Series MVP Orel Hershiser who capped a dominant 1988 season in which he set the all time scoreless inning streak at 59 innings, recorded five straight shutouts, led the league with 23 wins and 267 innings, and won the Cy Young and Gold Glove awards. Hershiser was the NL Championship Series MVP, starting three games, getting the save for Game 4, and shutting out the Mets in Game 7. In the World Series, he shut out the A's in Game 2, and pitched a two-run, complete game in the decisive Game 5 victory.
The Dodgers won the NL West division by seven games over the Cincinnati Reds, then upset the New York Mets, four games to three, in the NLCS. The Athletics won the AL West division by thirteen games over the Minnesota Twins, then swept the Boston Red Sox, four games to none, in the AL Championship Series.","{4736, 3842, 1795, 1539, 3332, 3459, 7, 2568, 4611, 4994, 2955, 3979, 2702, 2322, 3091, 2964, 3989, 1432, 290, 2210, 4642, 1319, 1576, 4007, 2171, 4140, 1709, 4400, 1847, 4407, 4920, 826, 1979, 2621, 4671, 3520, 1985, 2242, 1990, 967, 968, 2119, 4426, 2507, 1357, 1997, 4430, 4688, 4815, 5074, 595, 467, 4307, 1502, 889, 97, 2018, 3686, 1640, 4971, 748, 1133, 3180, 4589, 1395, 1780, 2169, 3322, 3451, 4990}",70,"['Oakland', 'Mark McGwire', '39', '1988', 'World Series', ""Major League Baseball's"", '1988', 'the World Series', 'the American League (AL', 'Oakland Athletics', 'the National League', 'Los Angeles Dodgers', 'Dodgers', 'Athletics', 'Series', 'Dodgers', 'Kirk Gibson', 'the NL Championship Series', 'Athletics', 'Dennis Eckersley', 'Game 1', 'Dodgers', 'World Series', 'the 1980s', 'World Series', 'the decade', '1981', 'World Series', 'Gibson', 'World Series', 'World Series', '1988', 'the Cy Young', 'Gold Glove', 'the NL Championship Series MVP', 'Game 4', 'Mets', 'Game 7', 'the World Series', 'Game 2', 'Game 5', 'Dodgers', 'NL West', 'the Cincinnati Reds', 'the New York Mets', 'NLCS', 'Athletics', 'AL West', 'the Minnesota Twins', 'the Boston Red Sox', 'the AL Championship Series']","['GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'EVENT']"

522,1988,February,4,Panamanian General Manuel Noriega indicted by US federal grand jury for drug trafficking and racketeering,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Noriega,"Manuel Antonio Noriega Moreno (Spanish pronunciation: [maˈnwel noˈɾjeɣa]; February 11, 1934 – May 29, 2017)  was a Panamanian politician and military officer who was the de facto ruler of Panama from 1983 to 1989. He had longstanding ties to United States intelligence agencies; however, he was removed from power by the U.S. invasion of Panama.
Born in Panama City to a poor mestizo family, Noriega studied at the Chorrillos Military School in Lima and at the School of the Americas. He became an officer in the Panamanian army, and rose through the ranks in alliance with Omar Torrijos. In 1968, Torrijos overthrew President Arnulfo Arias in a coup, establishing himself as leader; under Torrijos' government, Noriega became chief of military intelligence. After Torrijos' death in 1981, Noriega consolidated his power to become Panama's de facto ruler in 1983. From the 1950s until shortly before the U.S. invasion, Noriega worked with U.S. intelligence agencies. Noriega was one of the Central Intelligence Agency's most valued intelligence sources, as well as one of the primary conduits for illicit weapons, military equipment and cash destined for U.S.-backed counter-insurgency forces throughout Latin America. The U.S. also regarded Noriega as an ally in its War on Drugs, despite Noriega himself having amassed a personal fortune through drug trafficking operations. Though his U.S. intelligence handlers were aware of this, it was allowed because of his usefulness to the U.S.
Noriega relied upon military nationalism to maintain his support, and did not espouse a specific social or economic ideology.  In 1988, Noriega was indicted by federal grand juries  in Miami and Tampa on charges of racketeering, drug smuggling, and money laundering. Following the 1989 United States invasion of Panama, he was captured and flown to the United States, where he was tried on the Miami indictment. The trial, lasting from September 1991 to April 1992, ended with Noriega's conviction on most of the charges. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison, and ultimately served 17 years after a reduction in his sentence and time off for good behavior. Noriega's U.S. prison sentence ended in September 2007. In 2010, Noriega was extradited to France, where he was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for money laundering. In 2011 France extradited him to Panama, where he was incarcerated for crimes committed during his rule. Diagnosed with a brain tumor in March 2017, Noriega suffered complications during surgery, and died two months later.

523,1988,May,15,"USSR begins withdrawing its 115,000 troops from Afghanistan",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War,"The Soviet–Afghan War was a conflict wherein insurgent groups known collectively as the mujahideen, as well as smaller Maoist groups, fought a guerrilla war against the Soviet Army and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan government for over nine years, throughout the 1980s, mostly in the Afghan countryside. The mujahideen were backed primarily by the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Kingdom making it a Cold War proxy war. Between 562,000 and 2,000,000 civilians were killed and millions of Afghans fled the country as refugees, mostly to Pakistan and Iran.
The war derives from a 1978 coup when Afghanistan's communist party took power, initiating a series of radical modernization reforms throughout the country. These reforms were deeply unpopular among the more traditional rural population and established power structures. The repressive nature of Soviet Afghanistan, which vigorously suppressed opposition including the execution of thousands of political prisoners, led to the rise of anti-government armed groups and by April 1979 large parts of the country were in open rebellion. The ruling party itself experienced deep rivalries, and in September 1979 the President, Nur Mohammad Taraki, was murdered under orders of the second-in-command, Hafizullah Amin, which soured relations with the Soviet Union. Eventually the Soviet government, under leader Leonid Brezhnev, decided to deploy the 40th Army on December 24, 1979. Arriving in the capital Kabul, they staged a coup, killing president Amin and installing Soviet loyalist Babrak Karmal from a rival faction. The deployment had been variously called an ""invasion"" (by Western media and the rebels) or a legitimate supporting intervention (by the Soviet Union and the Afghan government) on the basis of the Brezhnev Doctrine.
In January 1980, foreign ministers from 34 nations of the Islamic Conference adopted a resolution demanding ""the immediate, urgent and unconditional withdrawal of Soviet troops"" from Afghanistan. The UN General Assembly passed a resolution protesting the Soviet intervention by a vote of 104 (for) to 18 (against), with 18 abstentions and 12 members of the 152-nation Assembly absent or not participating in the vote; only Soviet allies Angola, East Germany and Vietnam, along with India, supported the intervention. Afghan insurgents began to receive massive amounts of support through aid, finance and military training in neighbouring Pakistan with significant help from the United States and United Kingdom. They were also heavily financed by China and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Soviet troops occupied the cities and main arteries of communication, while the mujahideen waged guerrilla war in small groups operating in the almost 80 percent of the country that was outside government and Soviet control, almost exclusively being the rural countryside. The Soviets used their air power to deal harshly with both rebels and civilians, levelling villages to deny safe haven to the mujahideen, destroying vital irrigation ditches, and laying millions of land mines.The international community imposed numerous sanctions and embargoes against the Soviet Union, and the U.S. led a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow. The boycott and sanctions exacerbated Cold War tensions and enraged the Soviet government, which later led a revenge boycott of the 1984 Olympics held in Los Angeles. The Soviets initially planned to secure towns and roads, stabilize the government under new leader Karmal, and withdraw within six months or a year. But they were met with fierce resistance from the guerillas, and were stuck in a bloody war that lasted nine years. By the mid-1980s, the Soviet contingent was increased to 108,800 and fighting increased, but the military and diplomatic cost of the war to the USSR was high. By mid-1987 the Soviet Union, now under reformist leader Mikhail Gorbachev, announced it would start withdrawing its forces after meetings with the Afghan government. The final troop withdrawal started on May 15, 1988, and ended on February 15, 1989, leaving the government forces alone in the battle against the insurgents, which continued until 1992 when the former Soviet-backed government collapsed. Due to its length, it has sometimes been referred to as the ""Soviet Union's Vietnam War"" or the ""Bear Trap"" by the Western media. The Soviets' failure in the war is thought to be a contributing factor to the fall of the Soviet Union.",set(),0,"['USSR', 'Afghanistan', 'Soviet', 'Maoist', 'the Soviet Army', 'the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan', 'over nine years', 'the 1980s', 'Afghan', 'the United States', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Pakistan', 'the United Kingdom', 'Cold War', 'Afghans', 'Pakistan', 'Iran', '1978', 'Afghanistan', 'communist party', 'Soviet', 'Afghanistan', 'April 1979', 'September 1979', 'Nur Mohammad Taraki', 'Hafizullah Amin', 'the Soviet Union', 'Soviet', 'Leonid Brezhnev', 'the 40th Army', 'December 24, 1979', 'Kabul', 'Amin', 'Soviet', 'Babrak Karmal', 'the Soviet Union', 'Afghan', 'Brezhnev', 'January 1980', 'the Islamic Conference', 'Soviet', 'Afghanistan', 'The UN General Assembly', 'Soviet', 'Assembly', 'Soviet', 'Angola', 'East Germany', 'Vietnam', 'India', 'Afghan', 'Pakistan', 'the United States', 'United Kingdom', 'China', 'the Gulf Cooperation Council', 'Soviet', 'the almost 80 percent', 'Soviet', 'Soviets', 'the Soviet Union', 'U.S.', '1980', 'Summer Olympics', 'Moscow', 'Cold War', 'Soviet', '1984', 'Olympics', 'Los Angeles', 'Soviets', 'Karmal', 'six months or a year', 'nine years', 'the mid-1980s', 'Soviet', 'USSR', 'mid-1987', 'the Soviet Union', 'Mikhail Gorbachev', 'Afghan', 'May 15, 1988', 'February 15, 1989', '1992', 'Soviet', 'the ""Soviet Union\'s', 'Vietnam War', 'Soviets', 'the Soviet Union']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERCENT', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'GPE']"

525,1988,August,8,Ceasefire between Iran & Iraq takes effect after 8 years of war,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War,"The Iran–Iraq War (Persian: جنگ ایران و عراق‎) (Arabic: حرب الخليج الأولى‎) began on 22 September 1980, when Iraq invaded Iran, and it ended on 20 August 1988, when Iran accepted the UN-brokered ceasefire. Iraq wanted to replace Iran as the dominant Persian Gulf state, and was worried the 1979 Iranian Revolution would lead Iraq's Shi'ite majority to rebel against the Ba'athist government. The war also followed a long history of border disputes, and Iraq planned to annex the oil-rich Khuzestan Province and the east bank of the Shatt al-Arab (Arvand Rud).
Although Iraq hoped to take advantage of Iran's post-revolutionary chaos, it made limited progress and was quickly repelled; Iran regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982. For the next six years, Iran was on the offensive until near the end of the war. There were a number of proxy forces—most notably the People's Mujahedin of Iran siding with Iraq and the Iraqi Kurdish militias of the KDP and PUK siding with Iran. The United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and most Arab countries provided political and logistic support for Iraq, while Iran was largely isolated.
After eight years of war, war-exhaustion, economic devastation, decreased morale, military stalemate, international outrage against the use of weapons of mass destruction against civilians by Iraqi forces, and increased U.S.–Iran military tension all led to a ceasefire brokered by the United Nations.
The conflict has been compared to World War I in terms of the tactics used, including large-scale trench warfare with barbed wire stretched across fortified defensive lines, manned machine gun posts, bayonet charges, Iranian human wave attacks, extensive use of chemical weapons by Iraq, and, later, deliberate attacks on civilian targets. A special feature of the war can be seen in the Iranian cult of the martyr which had been developed in the years before the revolution. The discourses on martyrdom formulated in the Iranian Shiite context led to the tactics of ""human wave attacks"" and thus had a lasting impact on the dynamics of the war.An estimated 500,000 Iraqi and Iranian soldiers died, in addition to a smaller number of civilians. The end of the war resulted in neither reparations nor border changes.",set(),0,"['Iran & Iraq', '8 years', 'Iran', 'Iraq', 'Persian', 'Arabic', '22 September 1980', 'Iraq', 'Iran', '20 August 1988', 'Iran', 'UN', 'Iraq', 'Iran', 'Persian Gulf', '1979', 'Iranian Revolution', 'Iraq', ""Shi'ite"", ""Ba'athist"", 'Iraq', 'Khuzestan Province', 'Arvand Rud', 'Iraq', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'June 1982', 'the next six years', 'Iran', ""the People's Mujahedin"", 'Iran', 'Iraq', 'Iraqi', 'Kurdish', 'KDP', 'Iran', 'The United States', 'Britain', 'the Soviet Union', 'France', 'Arab', 'Iraq', 'Iran', 'eight years', 'Iraqi', 'the United Nations', 'World War I', 'Iranian', 'Iraq', 'Iranian', 'the years', 'Iranian', 'Shiite', 'Iraqi', 'Iranian']","['ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LANGUAGE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP']"

The concept was described by Martin Kramer as an academic term that ""will inevitably be [simplified to] jihadism or the jihadist movement in popular usage."" (emphasis supplied)Practitioners are referred to as ""Salafi jihadis"" or ""Salafi jihadists"". They are sometimes described as a variety of Salafi, and sometimes as separate from ""good Salafis"" whose movement eschews any political and organisational allegiances as potentially divisive for the Muslim community and a distraction from the study of religion.In the 1990s, extremist jihadists of the al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya were active in the attacks on police, government officials and tourists in Egypt, and Armed Islamic Group of Algeria was a principal group in the Algerian Civil War. The most infamous jihadist-Salafist attack is the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United States by al-Qaeda. While Salafism had next-to-no presence in Europe in the 1980s, Salafist jihadists had by the mid-2000s acquired ""a burgeoning presence in Europe, having attempted more than 30 terrorist attacks among E.U. countries since 2001."" While many see the influence and activities of Salafi jihadists as in decline after 2000 (at least in the United States), others see the movement as growing, in the wake of the Arab Spring and the breakdown of state control in Libya and Syria.","{128, 1025, 130, 640, 2052, 3842, 4097, 7, 903, 4993, 4994, 2955, 2703, 528, 3727, 1557, 278, 3989, 4895, 4768, 290, 2210, 4134, 4905, 2171, 182, 4407, 4024, 2875, 4539, 452, 965, 4549, 967, 2122, 971, 2507, 4682, 3322, 4815, 595, 3795, 4307, 1622, 5077, 889, 2529, 874, 4971, 3180, 4589, 494, 1649, 3185, 628, 3702, 2169, 4474, 3451, 2684, 4605, 3199}",62,"['Al-Qaeda', 'Osama bin Laden', 'Zawahiri', 'Peshawar', 'Pakistan', 'Salafi', 'jihadist-Salafism', 'Salafi', 'Sunni Islam', 'Salafist', 'Salafism', 'Gilles Kepel', '2002', 'Islamist', 'Islamist', 'Afghan', 'anti-Soviet', 'Martin Kramer', 'Salafi', 'Salafi', 'Salafi', 'Muslim', 'the 1990s', 'jihadists', ""al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya"", 'Egypt', 'Armed Islamic Group of Algeria', 'the Algerian Civil War', 'the September 11, 2001', 'the United States', 'al-Qaeda', 'Salafism', 'Europe', 'the 1980s', 'Salafist', 'the mid-2000s', 'Europe', 'E.U.', '2001', 'Salafi', '2000', 'the United States', 'the Arab Spring', 'Libya', 'Syria']","['ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE']"
527,1988,August,19,Iran-Iraq begin a cease-fire in their 8-year-old war (11 PM EDT),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War,"The Yom Kippur War, Ramadan War, or October War (Hebrew: מלחמת יום הכיפורים‎, Milẖemet Yom HaKipurim, or מלחמת יום כיפור, Milẖemet Yom Kipur; Arabic: حرب أكتوبر‎, Ḥarb ʾUktōbar, or حرب تشرين, Ḥarb Tišrīn), also known as the 1973 Arab–Israeli War, was a war fought from 6 to 25 October, 1973, by a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria against Israel. The war took place mostly in Sinai and the Golan—occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War—with some fighting in African Egypt and northern Israel. Egypt's initial war objective was to use its military to seize a foothold on the east bank of the Suez Canal and use this to negotiate the return of the rest of Sinai.The war began when the Arab coalition launched a joint surprise attack on Israeli positions, on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, which also occurred that year during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Egyptian and Syrian forces crossed ceasefire lines to enter the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights, respectively. Both the United States and the Soviet Union initiated massive resupply efforts to their respective allies during the war, and this led to a near-confrontation between the two nuclear superpowers.The war began with a massive and successful Egyptian crossing of the Suez Canal. Egyptian forces crossed the cease-fire lines, then advanced virtually unopposed into the Sinai Peninsula. After three days, Israel had mobilized most of its forces and halted the Egyptian offensive, resulting in a military stalemate. The Syrians coordinated their attack on the Golan Heights to coincide with the Egyptian offensive and initially made threatening gains into Israeli-held territory. Within three days, however, Israeli forces had pushed the Syrians back to the pre-war ceasefire lines. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) then launched a four-day counter-offensive deep into Syria. Within a week, Israeli artillery began to shell the outskirts of Damascus, and Egyptian President Sadat began to worry about the integrity of his major ally. He believed that capturing two strategic passes located deeper in the Sinai would make his position stronger during post-war negotiations; he therefore ordered the Egyptians to go back on the offensive, but their attack was quickly repulsed. The Israelis then counter-attacked at the seam between the two Egyptian armies, crossed the Suez Canal into Egypt, and began slowly advancing southward and westward towards the city of Suez in over a week of heavy fighting that resulted in heavy casualties on both sides.On 22 October, a United Nations–brokered ceasefire unraveled, with each side blaming the other for the breach. By 24 October, the Israelis had improved their positions considerably and completed their encirclement of Egypt's Third Army and the city of Suez. This development led to tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, and a second ceasefire was imposed cooperatively on 25 October to end the war.
The war had far-reaching implications. The Arab world had experienced humiliation in the lopsided rout of the Egyptian–Syrian–Jordanian alliance in the Six-Day War but felt psychologically vindicated by early successes in this conflict. The war led Israel to recognize that, despite impressive operational and tactical achievements on the battlefield, there was no guarantee that they would always dominate the Arab states militarily, as they had consistently through the earlier 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Suez Crisis, and the Six-Day War. These changes paved the way for the subsequent peace process. The 1978 Camp David Accords that followed led to the return of the Sinai to Egypt and normalized relations—the first peaceful recognition of Israel by an Arab country.

The mostly uncoordinated insurgency, often referred to as the Sha'aban Intifada among Shi'ite Arabs and as the National Uprising among Kurds, was fueled by the perception that then Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had become vulnerable to regime change. This perception of weakness was largely the result of the outcome of two prior wars: the Iran–Iraq War and the invasion of Kuwait, both of which occurred within a single decade and devastated the economy and population of Iraq.
Within the first two weeks, most of Iraq's cities and provinces fell to rebel forces. Participants of the uprising were a diverse mix of ethnic, religious and political affiliations, including military mutineers, Shia Arab Islamists, Kurdish nationalists, and far-left groups. Following initial victories, the revolution was held back from continued success by internal divisions as well as a lack of anticipated American support. Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated Ba'ath Party regime managed to maintain control over the capital of Baghdad and soon largely suppressed the rebels in a brutal campaign conducted by loyalist forces spearheaded by the Iraqi Republican Guard.
During the brief, roughly one-month period of unrest, tens of thousands of people died and nearly two million people were displaced. After the conflict, the Iraqi government intensified a prior systematic forced relocation of Marsh Arabs and the draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes in the Tigris–Euphrates river system. The Persian Gulf War Coalition established Iraqi no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq, and the Kurdish opposition established the Kurdish Autonomous Republic in Iraqi Kurdistan.","{4611, 2052, 7, 2568, 1041, 1557, 1566, 1058, 1576, 1584, 2104, 4157, 4671, 4682, 1616, 595, 1619, 1622, 1121, 2152, 1649, 3185, 2169, 2684, 640, 4235, 2703, 3727, 668, 4768, 2210, 3234, 1703, 2743, 3777, 3795, 4307, 4832, 748, 1272, 3322, 3834, 3842, 1795, 4895, 290, 3365, 1319, 4905, 4400, 1847, 4920, 826, 2875, 4413, 1855, 3908, 4937, 2891, 4437, 4445, 4971, 2924, 3446, 889, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 387, 3459, 4996, 2955, 3468, 3989, 1432, 3999, 4007, 5033, 1979, 4539, 452, 964, 965, 967, 1990, 4549, 971, 2507, 4558, 467, 2004, 4563, 5077, 1502, 2018, 4589, 494, 3578, 4605}",100,"['Kurdish', 'Iraq', 'Iran', '1991', 'Iraq', 'the 1991 Iraqi Civil War', 'Iraq', 'March', 'April 1991', 'the Persian Gulf War', ""Shi'ite Arabs"", 'the National Uprising', 'Kurds', 'Iraqi', 'Saddam Hussein', 'Iran', 'Kuwait', 'a single decade', 'Iraq', 'the first two weeks', 'Iraq', 'Shia Arab Islamists', 'Kurdish', 'American', 'Saddam', 'Sunni Arab', ""Ba'ath Party"", 'Baghdad', 'the Iraqi Republican Guard', 'one-month', 'Iraqi', 'Marsh Arabs', 'Mesopotamian', 'Tigris', 'Euphrates river', 'The Persian Gulf War Coalition', 'Iraqi', 'Iraq', 'Kurdish', 'the Kurdish Autonomous Republic', 'Iraqi', 'Kurdistan']","['NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE']"
529,1988,October,1,"Mikhail Gorbachev becomes Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, effectively head of state of the Soviet Union",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union,"The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was the founding and ruling political party of the Soviet Union. The CPSU was the sole governing party of the Soviet Union until 1990, when the Congress of People's Deputies modified Article 6 of the most recent 1977 Soviet constitution, which had granted the CPSU a monopoly over the political system.
The party was founded in 1912 by the Bolsheviks, a majority faction detached from the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, who seized power in the October Revolution of 1917. After 74 years, it was dissolved on 29 August 1991 on Soviet territory, soon after a failed coup d'état by hard-line CPSU leaders against Soviet president and party general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. It was completely outlawed three months later on 6 November 1991 on Russian territory.
The CPSU was a Communist party, organized on the basis of democratic centralism. This principle, conceived by Lenin, entails democratic and open discussion of policy issues within the party followed by the requirement of total unity in upholding the agreed policies. The highest body within the CPSU was the Party Congress, which convened every five years. When the Congress was not in session, the Central Committee was the highest body. Because the Central Committee met twice a year, most day-to-day duties and responsibilities were vested in the Politburo, (previously the Presidium), the Secretariat and the Orgburo (until 1952). The party leader was the head of government and held the office of either General Secretary, Premier or head of state, or some of the three offices concurrently—but never all three at the same time. The party leader was the de facto chairman of the CPSU Politburo and chief executive of the Soviet Union. The tension between the party and the state (Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union) for the shifting focus of power was never formally resolved, but in reality the party dominated and a paramount leader always existed (first Lenin and thereafter the General Secretary).
After the founding of the Soviet Union in 1922, Lenin had introduced a mixed economy, commonly referred to as the New Economic Policy, which allowed for capitalist practices to resume under the Communist Party dictation in order to develop the necessary conditions for socialism to become a practical pursuit in the economically undeveloped country. In 1929, as Joseph Stalin became the leader of the party, Marxism–Leninism, a fusion of the original ideas of German philosopher and economic theorist Karl Marx, and Lenin, became formalized as the party's guiding ideology and would remain so throughout the rest of its existence. The party pursued state socialism, under which all industries were nationalized and a command economy was implemented. After recovering from the Second World War, reforms were implemented which decentralized economic planning and liberalized Soviet society in general under Nikita Khrushchev. By 1980, various factors, including the continuing Cold War, and ongoing nuclear arms race with the United States and other Western European powers and unaddressed inefficiencies in the economy, led to stagnant economic growth under Alexei Kosygin, and further with  Leonid Brezhnev and a growing disillusionment. After the younger, vigorous Mikhail Gorbachev (b. 1931), assumed leadership in 1985, (following two short-term elderly leaders who quickly died in succession), rapid steps were taken to transform the tottering Soviet economic system in the direction of a market economy once again. Gorbachev and his allies envisioned the introduction of an economy similar to Lenin's earlier New Economic Policy through a program of ""perestroika"", or restructuring, but their reforms, along with the institution of free multi-candidate elections led to a decline in the party's power, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the banning of the party by later last RSFSR President Boris Yeltsin and subsequent first President of an evolving democratic and free market economy of the successor Russian Federation.
A number of causes contributed to CPSU's loss of control and the dissolution of the Soviet Union during the early 1990s. Some historians have written that Gorbachev's policy of ""glasnost"" (political openness) was the root cause, noting that it weakened the party's control over society. Gorbachev maintained that perestroika without glasnost was doomed to failure anyway. Others have blamed the economic stagnation and subsequent loss of faith by the general populace in communist ideology. In the final years of the CPSU's existence, the Communist Parties of the federal subjects of Russia were united into the Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). After the CPSU's demise, the Communist Parties of the Union Republics became independent and underwent various separate paths of reform. In Russia, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation emerged and has been regarded as the inheritor of the CPSU's old Bolshevik legacy into the present day.","{2051, 2568, 524, 1555, 3613, 4134, 1576, 1583, 4661, 2112, 2119, 4682, 595, 2141, 1633, 1646, 1136, 1649, 3190, 2169, 2171, 127, 640, 1153, 4736, 4235, 1678, 2191, 3727, 4768, 2210, 3752, 3243, 684, 174, 3777, 1228, 3795, 4307, 3803, 1251, 3812, 2793, 2794, 1783, 3322, 1275, 3842, 1288, 2322, 3862, 4895, 290, 3874, 4905, 1847, 2875, 4413, 4430, 4944, 3413, 2391, 1888, 1890, 3434, 4971, 2415, 3951, 889, 4474, 3451, 892, 4993, 4994, 2955, 3979, 1938, 3989, 1960, 4526, 2483, 4020, 4539, 452, 3524, 4549, 971, 2507, 1997, 5077, 2525, 1508, 5097, 2026, 1526, 2039, 2040, 4605}",98,"['Mikhail Gorbachev', 'the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet', 'the Soviet Union', 'The Communist Party', 'the Soviet Union', 'CPSU', 'the Soviet Union', 'the Soviet Union', '1990', ""the Congress of People's Deputies"", 'Article 6 of the most recent 1977', 'Soviet', '1912', 'Bolsheviks', 'the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party', 'Vladimir Lenin', 'the October Revolution of 1917', '74 years', '29 August 1991', 'Soviet', 'Soviet', 'Mikhail Gorbachev', 'three months later', 'Russian', 'Communist', 'Lenin', 'CPSU', 'the Party Congress', 'every five years', 'Congress', 'the Central Committee', 'the Central Committee', 'Politburo', 'Presidium', 'Secretariat', 'Orgburo', '1952', 'the CPSU Politburo', 'the Soviet Union', 'Council of Ministers of', 'the Soviet Union', 'Lenin', 'the Soviet Union', '1922', 'Lenin', 'the New Economic Policy', 'Communist Party', '1929', 'Joseph Stalin', 'German', 'Karl Marx', 'Lenin', 'the Second World War', 'Soviet', 'Nikita Khrushchev', '1980', 'Cold War', 'the United States', 'Western European', 'Alexei Kosygin', 'Leonid Brezhnev', 'Mikhail Gorbachev', '1931', '1985', 'Soviet', 'Gorbachev', 'Lenin', 'the Soviet Union', 'RSFSR', 'Boris Yeltsin', 'Russian Federation', 'CPSU', 'the Soviet Union', 'the early 1990s', 'Gorbachev', 'Gorbachev', 'the final years', 'CPSU', 'Russia', 'the Communist Party', 'Federative Socialist Republic', 'Communist', 'Russia', 'the Communist Party', 'the Russian Federation', 'the present day']","['PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE']"

Benazir Bhutto, twice Prime Minister of Pakistan (1988–1990; 1993–1996) and then-leader of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party, had been campaigning ahead of elections scheduled for January 2008. Shots were fired at her after a political rally at Liaquat National Bagh, and a suicide bomb was detonated immediately following the shooting. She was declared dead at 18:16 local time (13:16 UTC), at Rawalpindi General Hospital. Twenty-three other people were killed by the bombing. Bhutto had previously survived a similar attempt on her life (the 2007 Karsaz bombing) that killed at least 180 people, after her return from exile two months earlier.
Though early reports indicated that she had been hit by shrapnel or the gunshots, the Pakistani Interior Ministry initially stated that Bhutto died of a skull fracture sustained when the force of the explosion caused her head to strike the sunroof of the vehicle. Bhutto's aides rejected this version, and argued instead that she suffered two gunshots before the bomb detonation. The Interior Ministry subsequently backtracked from its previous claim.In May 2007, Bhutto asked for additional protection from foreign contracting agencies Blackwater and the British firm ArmorGroup.

Located in Western Asia, on the Armenian Highlands, it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Georgia to the north, the de facto independent Republic of Artsakh and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.Armenia is a unitary, multi-party, democratic nation-state with an ancient cultural heritage. Urartu was established in 860 BC and by the 6th century BC it was replaced by the Satrapy of Armenia. The Kingdom of Armenia reached its height under Tigranes the Great in the 1st century BC and became the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion in the late 3rd or early 4th century AD. The official date of state adoption of Christianity is 301. The ancient Armenian kingdom was split between the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires around the early 5th century. Under the Bagratuni dynasty, the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia was restored in the 9th century. Declining due to the wars against the Byzantines, the kingdom fell in 1045 and Armenia was soon after invaded by the Seljuk Turks. An Armenian principality and later a kingdom Cilician Armenia was located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea between the 11th and 14th centuries.
Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the traditional Armenian homeland composed of Eastern Armenia and Western Armenia came under the rule of the Ottoman and Iranian empires, repeatedly ruled by either of the two over the centuries. By the 19th century, Eastern Armenia had been conquered by the Russian Empire, while most of the western parts of the traditional Armenian homeland remained under Ottoman rule. During World War I, Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were systematically exterminated in the Armenian Genocide. In 1918, following the Russian Revolution, all non-Russian countries declared their independence after the Russian Empire ceased to exist, leading to the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia. By 1920, the state was incorporated into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, and in 1922 became a founding member of the Soviet Union. In 1936, the Transcaucasian state was dissolved, transforming its constituent states, including the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, into full Union republics. The modern Republic of Armenia became independent in 1991 during the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Armenia recognises the Armenian Apostolic Church, the world's oldest national church, as the country's primary religious establishment. The unique Armenian alphabet was invented by Mesrop Mashtots in 405 AD.
Armenia is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, the Council of Europe and the Collective Security Treaty Organization.

He received critical acclaim for his early 1970s albums and attained worldwide fame upon the release of Born to Run in 1975. During a career that has spanned five decades, Springsteen has become known for his poetic and socially conscious lyrics and lengthy, energetic stage performances, earning the nickname ""The Boss"". He has recorded both rock albums and folk-oriented works, and his lyrics often address the experiences and struggles of working-class Americans.
Born in the U.S.A. (1984) is Springsteen's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful album, proving him to be one of the most successful rock figures of the 1980s. It was certified 15x Platinum in the US and has sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Seven of its singles reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 including the title track, which was a bitter commentary on the treatment of Vietnam veterans — some of whom were Springsteen's friends. Advocating for the rights of the common working-class man, the song made a huge political impact. Springsteen's other best-known songs include ""Born to Run"" (1975), ""Thunder Road"" (1975), ""Badlands"" (1978), ""Hungry Heart"" (1980), ""Dancing in the Dark"" (1984), ""Glory Days"" (1985), ""Brilliant Disguise"" (1987), ""Human Touch"" (1992), ""Streets of Philadelphia"" (1994), and ""The Rising"" (2002).
Springsteen has sold more than 135 million records worldwide and more than 64 million records in the United States, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Tony Award (for Springsteen on Broadway). Springsteen was inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999, received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2009, was named MusiCares person of the year in 2013, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2016.","{7, 2568, 521, 3083, 3601, 3090, 1555, 4113, 1562, 2078, 34, 1058, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 3630, 1584, 4661, 2104, 1081, 4671, 576, 3139, 580, 1095, 75, 4688, 1622, 2647, 2649, 3163, 3676, 2141, 4192, 2152, 619, 3693, 1649, 4722, 2169, 2170, 3195, 640, 1162, 3722, 2703, 144, 3727, 1683, 1177, 154, 4768, 2213, 4775, 1192, 1193, 3243, 1709, 174, 4785, 2740, 3252, 703, 3777, 1732, 3272, 717, 4307, 3285, 4825, 3804, 1757, 3805, 4829, 3808, 1251, 2278, 3303, 234, 4330, 748, 3308, 1783, 1272, 762, 1275, 3322, 3842, 771, 1795, 1288, 1292, 1295, 272, 1808, 278, 795, 4895, 3874, 294, 810, 4917, 311, 4920, 4924, 1341, 3903, 1857, 843, 2891, 4942, 2388, 2901, 3413, 4437, 1386, 4971, 1905, 1907, 4472, 889, 3451, 4993, 4994, 3459, 900, 903, 2955, 3979, 1424, 3989, 1432, 3481, 3482, 1960, 2475, 4526, 2483, 3508, 4020, 4024, 5059, 452, 964, 3524, 5067, 2508, 1997, 4558, 5079, 3034, 478, 990, 1502, 2026, 4589, 5107, 2040, 3578, 4605}",161,"['Julianne Philips', 'Bruce Springsteen', 'Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen', 'September 23, 1949', 'American', 'the E Street Band', 'Born to Run', '1975', 'five decades', 'Springsteen', 'The Boss', 'Americans', 'U.S.A.', '1984', 'Springsteen', 'the 1980s', 'US', 'Vietnam', 'Springsteen', 'Springsteen', 'Born to Run', '1975', 'Thunder Road', '1975', 'Badlands', '1978', 'Hungry Heart', '1980', 'Dancing in the Dark', '1984', 'Glory Days', '1985', 'Brilliant Disguise', '1987', 'Human Touch', '1992', 'Streets of Philadelphia', '1994', 'The Rising', '2002', 'the United States', 'Grammy Awards', 'Golden Globes', 'a Tony Award', 'Springsteen on Broadway', 'Springsteen', 'the Songwriters Hall of Fame', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame', '1999', 'the Kennedy Center Honors', '2009', 'MusiCares', 'the year', '2013', 'the Presidential Medal of Freedom', 'Barack Obama', '2016']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"
543,1989,February,6,Solidarity union leader Lech Wałęsa begins negotiating with Polish government,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Poland_(1945%E2%80%931989),"The history of Poland from 1945 to 1989 spans the period of communist rule imposed by the Soviets over Poland after the end of World War II. These years, while featuring general industrialization, urbanization and many improvements in the standard of living, were marred by Stalinist repressions, social unrest, political strife and severe economic difficulties.
Near the end of World War II, the advancing Soviet Red Army, along with the Polish Armed Forces in the East, pushed out the Nazi German forces from occupied Poland. In February 1945, the Yalta Conference sanctioned the formation of a provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled Provisional Government of National Unity was formed in Warsaw by ignoring the Polish government-in-exile based in London since 1940.
During the subsequent Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, the three major Allies ratified the colossal westerly shift of the Polish frontier and approved its new territory between the Oder–Neisse line and Curzon Line, which resulted in Poland returning to its original borders that existed upon the foundation of the first Polish state in 966 AD. Following the destruction of the Polish-Jewish population in the Holocaust, the flight and expulsion of Germans in the west, resettlement of Ukrainians in the east, and the repatriation of Poles from the Eastern Borderlands (Kresy), Poland became for the first time in its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government solidified its political power, while the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) under Bolesław Bierut gained firm control over the country, which would remain an independent state within the Soviet sphere of influence. The July Constitution was promulgated on 22 July 1952 and the country officially became the Polish People's Republic (PRL).
Following Stalin's death in 1953, a political ""thaw"" allowed a more liberal faction of the Polish communists, led by Władysław Gomułka, to gain power. By the mid-1960s, Poland began experiencing increasing economic as well as political difficulties. They culminated in the 1968 Polish political crisis and the 1970 Polish protests, when a consumer price hike led to a wave of strikes. The government introduced a new economic program based on large-scale loans from western creditors, which resulted in a rise in living standards and expectations, but the program meant growing integration of Poland's economy with the world economy and it faltered after the 1973 oil crisis. In 1976, the government of Edward Gierek was forced to raise prices again and this led to the June 1976 protests.
This cycle of repression and reform and the economic-political struggle acquired new characteristics with the 1978 election of Karol Wojtyła as Pope John Paul II. Wojtyła's unexpected elevation strengthened the opposition to the authoritarian and ineffective system of nomenklatura-run state socialism, especially with the pope's first visit to Poland in 1979. In early August 1980, a new wave of strikes resulted in the founding of the independent trade union ""Solidarity"" (Solidarność) led by Lech Wałęsa. The growing strength and activity of the opposition caused the government of Wojciech Jaruzelski to declare martial law in December 1981. However, with the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union, increasing pressure from the West, and dysfunctional economy, the regime was forced to negotiate with its opponents. The 1989 Round Table Talks led to Solidarity's participation in the 1989 election. Its candidates' striking victory gave rise to the first of the succession of transitions from communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe.

Castro governed the Republic of Cuba as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1961 until 2011, Prime Minister from 1959 to 1976 and then as President of the Council of State and Council of Ministers from 1976 to 2008. Castro also served as the Commander-in-chief of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces. Under his administration, Cuba became a one-party communist state, while industry and business were nationalized and state socialist policies were implemented throughout society.
Born in Birán, Oriente as the son of a wealthy Spanish farmer, Castro adopted leftist anti-imperialist ideas while studying law at the University of Havana. After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, he planned the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953. After a year's imprisonment, Castro traveled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group, the 26th of July Movement, with his brother Raúl Castro and Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. Returning to Cuba, Castro took a key role in the Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista's forces from the Sierra Maestra. After Batista's overthrow in 1959, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's Prime Minister. The United States came to oppose Castro's government and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination, economic blockade, and counter-revolution, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961. Countering these threats, Castro aligned with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba, resulting in the Cuban Missile Crisis – a defining incident of the Cold War – in 1962.
Adopting a Marxist–Leninist model of development, Castro converted Cuba into a one-party, socialist state under Communist Party rule, the first in the Western Hemisphere. Policies introducing central economic planning and expanding healthcare and education were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression of internal dissent. Abroad, Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary groups, backing the establishment of Marxist governments in Chile, Nicaragua, and Grenada, as well as sending troops to aid allies in the Yom Kippur, Ogaden, and Angolan Civil War. These actions, coupled with Castro's leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1979 to 1983 and Cuba's medical internationalism, increased Cuba's profile on the world stage. Following the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991, Castro led Cuba through the economic downturn of the ""Special Period"", embracing environmentalist and anti-globalization ideas. In the 2000s, Castro forged alliances in the Latin American ""pink tide"" – namely with Hugo Chávez's Venezuela – and signed Cuba up to the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. In 2006, Castro transferred his responsibilities to Vice President Raúl Castro, who was elected to the presidency by the National Assembly in 2008.
The longest-serving non-royal head of state in the 20th and 21st centuries, Castro polarized opinion throughout the world. His supporters view him as a champion of socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary regime advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba's independence from US hegemony. Critics view him as a tyrannical dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses, the exodus of a large number of Cubans, and the impoverishment of the country's economy. Castro was decorated with various international awards and significantly influenced different individuals and groups across the world.","{2051, 4101, 3598, 1555, 4642, 1573, 4134, 4647, 2096, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4174, 4688, 3154, 595, 2141, 608, 3686, 2155, 3180, 1646, 2159, 1136, 1653, 3190, 2169, 640, 4736, 131, 1678, 2702, 4758, 2713, 4768, 2721, 1710, 3759, 182, 2760, 1739, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 213, 2262, 4824, 4313, 3803, 3805, 3812, 1780, 757, 4859, 3842, 1795, 1803, 1808, 2322, 3348, 3862, 3869, 290, 3877, 807, 810, 812, 4916, 311, 1847, 826, 832, 4426, 4430, 1873, 2391, 1888, 3936, 1890, 870, 873, 3434, 1388, 3951, 4474, 4990, 3970, 387, 3460, 5003, 1422, 1938, 1432, 3489, 4007, 1960, 4014, 2483, 2995, 4539, 3520, 5060, 965, 1990, 967, 4549, 5065, 971, 2507, 5074, 467, 5077, 3542, 3040, 2018, 997, 5106}",120,"['Chinese', 'Beijing', 'Tiananmen Square', 'Fidel Alejandro', 'American', 'Spanish', 'August 1926', 'November 2016', 'Cuban', 'Marxist', 'Leninist', 'Cuban', 'Castro', 'the Republic of Cuba', 'the Communist Party', 'Cuba', '1961', '2011', '1959', '1976', 'the Council of State and Council of Ministers', '1976 to 2008', 'Castro', 'the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces', 'Cuba', 'communist', 'Birán', 'Oriente', 'Spanish', 'Castro', 'the University of Havana', 'the Dominican Republic and Colombia', 'Cuban', 'Fulgencio Batista', 'the Moncada Barracks', '1953', 'year', 'Castro', 'Mexico', 'Raúl Castro', 'Ernesto', 'Che"" Guevara', 'Cuba', 'Castro', 'the Cuban Revolution', 'Batista', 'the Sierra Maestra', 'Batista', '1959', 'Castro', 'Cuba', 'The United States', 'Castro', 'the Bay of Pigs Invasion', '1961', 'Castro', 'the Soviet Union', 'Soviets', 'Cuba', 'Cuban', 'the Cold War', '1962', 'Marxist', 'Castro', 'Cuba', 'Communist Party', 'the Western Hemisphere', 'Castro', 'Marxist', 'Chile', 'Nicaragua', 'Grenada', 'the Yom Kippur', 'Ogaden', 'Angolan Civil War', 'Castro', 'the Non-Aligned Movement', '1979 to 1983', 'Cuba', 'Cuba', ""the Soviet Union's"", '1991', 'Castro', 'Cuba', 'the 2000s', 'Castro', 'Latin American', ""Hugo Chávez's"", 'Venezuela', 'Cuba', 'the Bolivarian Alliance', 'Americas', '2006', 'Castro', 'Raúl Castro', 'the National Assembly', '2008', 'the 20th and 21st centuries', 'Castro', 'Cuba', 'US', 'Cubans', 'Castro']","['NORP', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON']"

Prior to the unification of China by the First Emperor in 221 BC, Beijing had been for centuries the capital of the ancient states of Ji and Yan. During the first millennia of imperial rule, Beijing was a provincial city in northern China. Its stature grew in the 10th to the 13th centuries when the nomadic Khitan and forest-dwelling Jurchen peoples from beyond the Great Wall expanded southward and made the city a capital of their dynasties, the Liao and Jin. When Kublai Khan made Dadu the capital of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty (1279–1368), all of China was ruled from Beijing for the first time. From 1279 onward, with the exception of two interludes from 1368 to 1420 and 1928 to 1949, Beijing would remain as China's capital, serving as the seat of power for the Ming dynasty (1421–1644), the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644–1912), the early Republic of China (1912–1928) and now the People's Republic of China (1949–present).","{3842, 2051, 387, 7, 3989, 3862, 1177, 28, 4642, 1706, 1834, 173, 2868, 182, 2682, 961, 1985, 967, 1739, 717, 2509, 4430, 595, 2388, 4051, 4307, 1370, 987, 3803, 2141, 1888, 1890, 3812, 873, 1769, 4971, 1388, 4589, 1136, 1780, 2169, 3322, 3451}",43,"['Chinese', 'Tiananmen Square', 'Beijing', 'Beijing', '3,000 years', 'China', 'BC', 'Beijing', 'centuries', 'Ji', 'Yan', 'Beijing', 'China', 'the 10th to the 13th centuries', 'Khitan', 'Jurchen', 'the Great Wall', 'Liao', 'Jin', 'Kublai Khan', 'China', 'Beijing', '1279', '1368', '1420', '1949', 'Beijing', 'China', 'the Ming dynasty', 'Manchu', 'the early Republic of China', ""the People's Republic of China""]","['NORP', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE']"

These years, while featuring general industrialization, urbanization and many improvements in the standard of living, were marred by Stalinist repressions, social unrest, political strife and severe economic difficulties.
Near the end of World War II, the advancing Soviet Red Army, along with the Polish Armed Forces in the East, pushed out the Nazi German forces from occupied Poland. In February 1945, the Yalta Conference sanctioned the formation of a provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled Provisional Government of National Unity was formed in Warsaw by ignoring the Polish government-in-exile based in London since 1940.
During the subsequent Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, the three major Allies ratified the colossal westerly shift of the Polish frontier and approved its new territory between the Oder–Neisse line and Curzon Line, which resulted in Poland returning to its original borders that existed upon the foundation of the first Polish state in 966 AD. Following the destruction of the Polish-Jewish population in the Holocaust, the flight and expulsion of Germans in the west, resettlement of Ukrainians in the east, and the repatriation of Poles from the Eastern Borderlands (Kresy), Poland became for the first time in its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government solidified its political power, while the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) under Bolesław Bierut gained firm control over the country, which would remain an independent state within the Soviet sphere of influence. The July Constitution was promulgated on 22 July 1952 and the country officially became the Polish People's Republic (PRL).
Following Stalin's death in 1953, a political ""thaw"" allowed a more liberal faction of the Polish communists, led by Władysław Gomułka, to gain power. By the mid-1960s, Poland began experiencing increasing economic as well as political difficulties. They culminated in the 1968 Polish political crisis and the 1970 Polish protests, when a consumer price hike led to a wave of strikes. The government introduced a new economic program based on large-scale loans from western creditors, which resulted in a rise in living standards and expectations, but the program meant growing integration of Poland's economy with the world economy and it faltered after the 1973 oil crisis. In 1976, the government of Edward Gierek was forced to raise prices again and this led to the June 1976 protests.
This cycle of repression and reform and the economic-political struggle acquired new characteristics with the 1978 election of Karol Wojtyła as Pope John Paul II. Wojtyła's unexpected elevation strengthened the opposition to the authoritarian and ineffective system of nomenklatura-run state socialism, especially with the pope's first visit to Poland in 1979. In early August 1980, a new wave of strikes resulted in the founding of the independent trade union ""Solidarity"" (Solidarność) led by Lech Wałęsa. The growing strength and activity of the opposition caused the government of Wojciech Jaruzelski to declare martial law in December 1981. However, with the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union, increasing pressure from the West, and dysfunctional economy, the regime was forced to negotiate with its opponents. The 1989 Round Table Talks led to Solidarity's participation in the 1989 election. Its candidates' striking victory gave rise to the first of the succession of transitions from communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe.

549,1989,June,4,"Tiananmen Square Massacre: Chinese troops clear the square of student protesters, unofficial figures place death toll near 1,000",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War,"The Korean War (in South Korean Korean: 한국전쟁; Hanja: 韓國戰爭; RR: Hanguk Jeonjaeng, ""Korean War""; in North Korean Korean: 조국해방전쟁; Hanja: 祖國解放戰爭; MR: Choguk haebang chŏnjaeng, ""Fatherland Liberation War""; 25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953) was a war between North Korea (with the support of China and the Soviet Union) and South Korea (with the support of the United Nations, principally from the United States). The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea.At the end of World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945. After the war had ended, Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation, the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half. With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948, two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War (between the Soviet Union and the United States). A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee. Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent. 
The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military (Korean People's Army, KPA) forces—supported by the Soviet Union and China—crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950. The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion. In theory, while the Soviet Union and China both technically held veto power, China's seat in the United Nations was held by the Republic of China, and representatives from the Soviet Union were boycotting United Nations meetings due to China's seat being occupied by Taiwan. Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force, with the United States providing around 90% of the military personnel.After the first two months of war, South Korean Army (ROKA) and the US forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat. As a result, the ROKA and US troops retreated to a small area behind a defensive line known as the Pusan Perimeter. In September 1950, an amphibious UN counter-offensive was launched at Incheon, and cut off many KPA troops in South Korea. Those who escaped envelopment and capture were forced back north. UN forces invaded North Korea in October 1950 and moved rapidly towards the Yalu River—the border with China—but on 19 October 1950, Chinese forces of the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) crossed the Yalu and entered the war. The surprise Chinese intervention triggered a retreat of UN forces back below the 38th Parallel by late December.
In these and subsequent battles, Seoul changed hands four times, and the last two years of fighting became a war of attrition, with the front line close to the 38th Parallel. The war in the air, however, was never a stalemate. North Korea was subject to a massive U.S. bombing campaign. Jet fighters confronted each other in air-to-air combat for the first time in history, and Soviet pilots covertly flew in defense of their communist allies.
The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. The agreement created the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to separate North and South Korea, and allowed the return of prisoners. However, no peace treaty was ever signed, and the two Koreas are technically still at war, engaged in a frozen conflict. In April 2018, the leaders of North and South Korea met at the DMZ and agreed to work towards a treaty to formally end the Korean War.The Korean War was among the most destructive conflicts of the modern era, with approximately 3 million war fatalities and a larger proportional civilian death toll than World War II or the Vietnam War. It incurred the destruction of virtually all of Korea's major cities, thousands of massacres by both sides (including the mass killing of tens of thousands of suspected communists by the South Korean government), and the torture and starvation of prisoners of war by the North Korean command. North Korea became among the most heavily-bombed countries in history.","{1027, 2568, 521, 3083, 524, 1036, 528, 3090, 1555, 1556, 1562, 28, 2589, 2078, 1566, 1058, 4642, 3621, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 3630, 2095, 1584, 4661, 2104, 1081, 1084, 575, 2112, 4671, 3139, 580, 2649, 2652, 4192, 98, 3174, 2152, 3692, 1133, 4718, 1136, 1137, 3186, 1139, 3702, 3195, 2171, 640, 2176, 131, 4235, 3727, 144, 1170, 2200, 154, 4768, 2210, 2213, 1703, 2215, 2216, 3752, 3243, 1197, 174, 1709, 1711, 4785, 703, 4287, 1729, 3777, 1731, 3268, 4802, 4807, 717, 718, 208, 3795, 4307, 2775, 1752, 1244, 3804, 3805, 4829, 1248, 3301, 3813, 3303, 4330, 747, 748, 2798, 1783, 2297, 3322, 1275, 3842, 771, 1795, 3332, 4871, 4874, 1292, 272, 785, 3862, 3869, 4895, 3874, 805, 2342, 1319, 1832, 4905, 3882, 302, 4400, 4913, 4915, 4916, 309, 310, 311, 825, 3385, 2875, 4923, 1341, 830, 3903, 4413, 1857, 325, 2891, 4941, 847, 4944, 3413, 4437, 1370, 1888, 1890, 355, 1386, 4971, 877, 1908, 4472, 889, 4986, 892, 4990, 4991, 4993, 4994, 3459, 900, 3460, 903, 1931, 2955, 3979, 3980, 912, 401, 1938, 5010, 3490, 4516, 3495, 5037, 4526, 4016, 4017, 2483, 437, 4536, 1979, 5059, 452, 964, 3524, 5065, 5067, 2508, 1997, 4558, 463, 2004, 5077, 5079, 3544, 3034, 2525, 478, 1502, 3040, 3046, 5097, 4074, 492, 3564, 494, 2036, 2039, 1017, 3578, 2555, 4605}",216,"['Tiananmen Square', 'Chinese', 'The Korean War', 'South Korean', 'Korean', 'Hanja', 'Hanguk Jeonjaeng', 'Korean War', 'North Korean', 'Korean', 'Hanja', 'Choguk', 'Fatherland Liberation War', 'June 1950', '27 July 1953', 'North Korea', 'China', 'the Soviet Union', 'South Korea', 'the United Nations', 'the United States', '25 June 1950', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'World War II', 'the Soviet Union', 'the United States', 'Korea', 'Japanese', '15 August 1945', 'Korea', 'Soviets', 'Americans', '1948', 'the Cold War', 'the Soviet Union', 'the United States', 'Kim Il-sung', 'Syngman Rhee', 'Korean', 'Korea', 'North Korean', ""Korean People's Army"", 'KPA', 'the Soviet Union', 'China', 'South Korea', '25 June 1950', 'The United Nations Security Council', 'the United Nations Command', 'Korea', 'North Korean', 'the Soviet Union', 'China', 'China', 'the United Nations', 'the Republic of China', 'the Soviet Union', 'United Nations', 'China', 'Taiwan', 'the United Nations', 'UN', 'the United States', 'around 90%', 'the first two months', 'South Korean Army', 'ROKA', 'US', 'Korea', 'ROKA', 'US', 'the Pusan Perimeter', 'September 1950', 'UN', 'Incheon', 'KPA', 'South Korea', 'UN', 'North Korea', 'October 1950', 'the Yalu River', 'China', '19 October 1950', 'Chinese', ""the People's Volunteer Army"", 'PVA', 'Yalu', 'Chinese', 'UN', 'late December', 'Seoul', 'the last two years', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Soviet', '27 July 1953', 'the Korean Armistice Agreement', 'the Korean Demilitarized Zone', 'North and', 'South Korea', 'Koreas', 'April 2018', 'North and', 'South Korea', 'DMZ', 'the Korean War', 'The Korean War', 'World War II', 'the Vietnam War', 'Korea', 'South Korean', 'North Korean', 'North Korea']","['PERSON', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE']"
550,1989,November,10,Germans begin demolishing the Berlin Wall,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall,"The Berlin Wall (German: Berliner Mauer, pronounced [bɛʁˈliːnɐ ˈmaʊ̯ɐ] (listen)) was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989. Construction of the Wall was commenced by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) on 13 August 1961. The Wall cut off West Berlin from surrounding East Germany, including East Berlin. The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area (later known as the ""death strip"") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, beds of nails, and other defenses. The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the ""will of the people"" from building a socialist state in East Germany.
GDR authorities officially referred to the Berlin Wall as the Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart (German: Antifaschistischer Schutzwall). The West Berlin city government sometimes referred to it as the ""Wall of Shame"", a term coined by mayor Willy Brandt in reference to the Wall's restriction on freedom of movement. Along with the separate and much longer Inner German border (IGB), which demarcated the border between East and West Germany, it came to physically symbolize the ""Iron Curtain"" that separated Western Europe and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War.Before the Wall's erection, 3.5 million East Germans circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions and defected from the GDR, many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin; from there they could then travel to West Germany and to other Western European countries. Between 1961 and 1989, the Wall prevented almost all such emigration. During this period, over 100,000 people attempted to escape, and over 5,000 people succeeded in escaping over the Wall, with an estimated death toll ranging from 136 to more than 200 in and around Berlin.
In 1989, a series of revolutions in nearby Eastern Bloc countries—in Poland and Hungary in particular—caused a chain reaction in East Germany that ultimately resulted in the demise of the Wall. After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the Wall, joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere. Over the next few weeks, euphoric people and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the Wall. The Brandenburg Gate, a few meters from the Berlin Wall, was opened on 22 December 1989. The demolition of the Wall officially began on 13 June 1990 and was completed in November 1991. The ""fall of the Berlin Wall"" paved the way for German reunification, which formally took place on 3 October 1990.","{640, 4993, 3842, 387, 1795, 3970, 4994, 7, 2568, 2955, 4235, 2191, 2703, 3727, 2322, 3989, 4758, 4895, 4768, 2721, 290, 4134, 4905, 4402, 2104, 4024, 4536, 2875, 4539, 4413, 3520, 452, 3908, 4549, 967, 2119, 841, 2122, 971, 1483, 2379, 2507, 4430, 4682, 4815, 3154, 595, 2388, 3666, 1622, 3795, 4307, 4563, 5074, 5077, 4445, 889, 3046, 2152, 4971, 3180, 4589, 1649, 3322, 2040, 2169, 4474, 3451, 4605, 2302, 4859}",71,"['Germans', 'the Berlin Wall', 'The Berlin Wall', 'German', 'Berliner Mauer', 'Berlin', '1961 to 1989', 'the German Democratic Republic', 'GDR', 'East Germany', '13 August 1961', 'West Berlin', 'East Germany', 'East Berlin', 'The Eastern Bloc', 'East Germany', 'GDR', 'the Berlin Wall', 'Rampart', 'German', 'Antifaschistischer Schutzwall', 'West Berlin', 'Wall of Shame', 'Willy Brandt', 'Inner German', 'IGB', 'East', 'West Germany', 'Western Europe', 'the Eastern Bloc', 'the Cold War', 'East Germans', 'Eastern Bloc', 'GDR', 'East Berlin', 'West Berlin', 'West Germany', 'Western European', 'Between 1961 and 1989', 'Berlin', '1989', 'Eastern Bloc', 'Poland', 'Hungary', 'East Germany', 'several weeks', 'East German', '9 November 1989', 'GDR', 'West Germany', 'West Berlin', 'East Germans', 'West Germans', 'the next few weeks', 'The Brandenburg Gate', 'the Berlin Wall', '22 December 1989', 'June 1990', 'November 1991', 'the Berlin Wall', 'German', '3 October 1990']","['NORP', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'DATE']"
551,1989,December,3,"Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and US President George H. W. Bush, declare the Cold War over",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush,"George Herbert Walker Bush (June 12, 1924 – November 30, 2018) was an American politician and businessman who served as the 41st president of the United States from 1989 to 1993. A member of the Republican Party, Bush also served in the U.S. House of Representatives, as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, as Director of Central Intelligence, and as the 43rd vice president.
Bush was raised in Greenwich, Connecticut and attended Phillips Academy before serving in the United States Navy during World War II. After the war, he graduated from Yale University and moved to West Texas, where he established a successful oil company. After an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate, he won election to the 7th congressional district of Texas in 1966. President Richard Nixon appointed Bush to the position of Ambassador to the United Nations in 1971 and to the position of chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1973. In 1974, President Gerald Ford appointed him as the Chief of the Liaison Office to the People's Republic of China, and in 1976 Bush became the Director of Central Intelligence. Bush ran for president in 1980, but was defeated in the Republican presidential primaries by Ronald Reagan. He was then elected vice president in 1980 and 1984 as Reagan's running mate.
In the 1988 presidential election, Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis, becoming the first incumbent vice president to be elected president in 152 years. Foreign policy drove the Bush presidency, as he navigated the final years of the Cold War and played a key role in the reunification of Germany. Bush presided over the invasion of Panama and the Gulf War, ending the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in the latter conflict. Though the agreement was not ratified until after he left office, Bush negotiated and signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which created a trade bloc consisting of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Domestically, Bush reneged on a 1988 campaign promise by signing a bill that increased taxes and helped reduce the federal budget deficit. He also signed the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and appointed David Souter and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. Bush lost the 1992 presidential election to Democrat Bill Clinton following an economic recession and the decreased emphasis of foreign policy in a post–Cold War political climate.
After leaving office in 1993, Bush was active in humanitarian activities, often working alongside Clinton, his former opponent. With George W. Bush's victory in the 2000 presidential election, Bush and his son became the second father–son pair to serve as the nation's president, following John Adams and John Quincy Adams. Another son, Jeb Bush, unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 Republican primaries. After a long battle with vascular Parkinson's disease, Bush died at his home on November 30, 2018. Historians generally rank Bush as an above average president.

552,1989,December,22,"After 23 years of dictatorial rule, Romania ousts Nicolae Ceausescu",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siad_Barre,"Jaalle Mohamed Siad Barre (Somali: Jaale Maxamed Siyaad Barre; Arabic: محمد سياد بري‎; October 6, 1919 – January 2, 1995) was a Somali politician who served as the President of the Somali Democratic Republic from 1969 to 1991. 
Barre, a major general of the gendarmerie, became President of Somalia after the 1969 coup d'état that overthrew the Somali Republic following the assassination of President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke. The Supreme Revolutionary Council military junta under Barre reconstituted Somalia as a one-party Marxist–Leninist communist state, renaming the country the Somali Democratic Republic and adopting scientific socialism, with support from the Soviet Union. Barre's early rule was characterised by attempts at widespread modernization, nationalization of banks and industry, promotion of cooperative farms, a new writing system for the Somali language, and anti-tribalism. The Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party became Somalia's vanguard party in 1976, and Barre started the Ogaden War against Ethiopia on a platform of Somali nationalism and pan-Somalism. 
Barre's popularity was highest during the seven months between September 1977 and March 1978 when Barre captured virtually the entirety of the Somali region. It declined from the late-1970s following Somalia's defeat in the Ogaden War, triggering the Somali Rebellion and severing ties with the Soviet Union. Opposition grew in the 1980s due to his increasingly dictatorial rule, growth of tribal politics, abuses of the National Security Service including the Isaaq genocide, and the sharp decline of Somalia's economy. In 1991, Barre's government collapsed as the Somali Rebellion successfully ejected him from power, leading to the Somali Civil War, and forcing him into exile where he died in Nigeria in 1995.","{1026, 2051, 7, 524, 1555, 1557, 1058, 4661, 2112, 4682, 595, 1622, 2141, 1646, 1136, 1649, 3190, 3702, 2169, 2682, 2171, 2684, 127, 128, 640, 4736, 4235, 1678, 2703, 3727, 1177, 4768, 2210, 3752, 3243, 1709, 174, 1222, 1739, 1228, 3795, 4307, 3803, 3812, 3322, 3842, 3862, 791, 4895, 290, 3874, 4905, 2875, 4413, 2379, 4430, 2388, 3413, 2391, 4445, 1888, 1890, 4971, 1388, 3951, 889, 4474, 3451, 892, 890, 4993, 4994, 387, 903, 2955, 3979, 1938, 3989, 2475, 4526, 2483, 4020, 4024, 4539, 452, 3524, 4549, 967, 971, 2507, 467, 2004, 4051, 5077, 2525, 1502, 2529, 4589, 3571, 4605}",100,"['23 years', 'Romania', 'Nicolae Ceausescu', 'Jaalle Mohamed Siad Barre', 'Somali', 'Jaale Maxamed Siyaad Barre', 'Arabic', 'بري\u200e', 'October 6, 1919', 'January 2, 1995', 'Somali', 'the Somali Democratic Republic', '1969 to 1991', 'Somalia', '1969', 'the Somali Republic', 'Abdirashid Ali Shermarke', 'The Supreme Revolutionary Council', 'Barre', 'Somalia', 'Marxist', 'Leninist', 'communist', 'the Somali Democratic Republic', 'the Soviet Union', 'Barre', 'Somali', 'The Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party', 'Somalia', '1976', 'Barre', 'the Ogaden War', 'Ethiopia', 'Somali', 'pan-Somalism', 'Barre', 'the seven months between September 1977 and March 1978', 'Barre', 'Somali', 'Somalia', 'the Ogaden War', 'the Somali Rebellion', 'the Soviet Union', 'the 1980s', 'the National Security Service', 'Isaaq', 'Somalia', '1991', 'Barre', 'the Somali Rebellion', 'the Somali Civil War', 'Nigeria', '1995']","['DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'LANGUAGE', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE']"

His works frequently address the topics of globalization and capitalism.
Moore won the 2002 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for Bowling for Columbine, which examined the causes of the Columbine High School massacre and the overall gun culture of the United States. He also directed and produced Fahrenheit 9/11, a critical look at the presidency of George W. Bush and the War on Terror, which earned $119,194,771 to become the highest-grossing documentary at the American box office of all time. The film also won the Palme d'Or at the 2004 Cannes film festival. His documentary Sicko, which examines health care in the United States, is one of the top ten highest-grossing documentaries as of 2020. In September 2008, he released his first free movie on the internet, Slacker Uprising, which documented his personal quest to encourage more Americans to vote in presidential elections. He has also written and starred in the TV shows TV Nation, a satirical news-magazine television series, and The Awful Truth, a satirical show. In 2018 he released his latest film, Fahrenheit 11/9, a documentary about the 2016 United States presidential election and the subsequent presidency of Donald Trump.
Moore's written and cinematic works criticize topics such as globalization, large corporations, assault weapon ownership, American Presidents Bill Clinton, George W.

560,1989,October,15,Wayne Gretzky passes Gordie Howe as NHL's all time top scorer,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky,"Wayne Douglas Gretzky  (; born January 26, 1961) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and former head coach. He played 20 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for four teams from 1979 to 1999. Nicknamed ""The Great One"", he has been called ""the greatest hockey player ever"" by many sportswriters, players, and the NHL itself. Gretzky is the leading scorer in NHL history, with more goals and assists than any other player. He garnered more assists than any other player scored total points, and is the only NHL player to total over 200 points in one season – a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, Gretzky tallied over 100 points in 16 professional seasons, 14 of them consecutive. At the time of his retirement in 1999, he held 61 NHL records: 40 regular season records, 15 playoff records, and 6 All-Star records.Born and raised in Brantford, Ontario, Canada, Gretzky honed his skills at a backyard rink and regularly played minor hockey at a level far above his peers. Despite his unimpressive stature, strength and speed, Gretzky's intelligence and reading of the game were unrivaled. He was adept at dodging checks from opposing players, and consistently anticipated where the puck was going to be and executed the right move at the right time. Gretzky became known for setting up behind his opponent's net, an area that was nicknamed ""Gretzky's office"".In 1978, Gretzky signed with the Indianapolis Racers of the World Hockey Association (WHA), where he briefly played before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers. When the WHA folded, the Oilers joined the NHL, where he established many scoring records and led his team to four Stanley Cup championships. Gretzky's trade to the Los Angeles Kings on August 9, 1988, had an immediate impact on the team's performance, eventually leading them to the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, and he is credited with popularizing hockey in California. Gretzky played briefly for the St. Louis Blues before finishing his career with the New York Rangers. Gretzky captured nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable player, 10 Art Ross Trophies for most points in a season, two Conn Smythe Trophies as playoff MVP and five Lester B. Pearson Awards (now called the Ted Lindsay Award) for most outstanding player as judged by his peers. He led the league in goal-scoring five times and assists 16 times, won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for sportsmanship and performance five times, and often spoke out against fighting in hockey.After his retirement in 1999, Gretzky was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, making him the most recent player to have the waiting period waived. The NHL retired his jersey number 99 league-wide, making him the only player to receive such an honour. Gretzky was one of six players voted to the International Ice Hockey Federation's (IIHF) Centennial All-Star Team. Gretzky became executive director for the Canadian national men's hockey team during the 2002 Winter Olympics, in which the team won a gold medal. In 2000, he became part-owner of the Phoenix Coyotes, and following the 2004–05 NHL lock-out, he became the team's head coach. In 2004, Gretzky was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. In September 2009, following the Phoenix Coyotes' bankruptcy, Gretzky resigned as head coach and relinquished his ownership share. In October 2016, he became partner and vice-chairman of Oilers Entertainment Group.",{4815},1,"['Wayne Gretzky', 'Gordie Howe', 'NHL', 'Wayne Douglas Gretzky', 'January 26, 1961', 'Canadian', '20 seasons', 'the National Hockey League', 'NHL', '1979 to 1999', '""The Great One""', 'NHL', 'Gretzky', 'NHL', 'NHL', 'one season', 'Gretzky', '1999', 'NHL', 'Brantford', 'Ontario', 'Canada', 'Gretzky', 'Gretzky', 'Gretzky', 'Gretzky\'s office""', '1978', 'Gretzky', 'the Indianapolis Racers of', 'the World Hockey Association', 'WHA', 'the Edmonton Oilers', 'WHA', 'Oilers', 'NHL', 'Stanley Cup', 'Gretzky', 'the Los Angeles Kings', 'August 9, 1988', '1993', 'Stanley Cup Finals', 'California', 'Gretzky', 'the St. Louis Blues', 'the New York Rangers', 'Gretzky', 'Art Ross', 'season', 'Conn Smythe Trophies', 'Lester B.

He is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. In December 2002, he was chosen by Wisden as the greatest ODI batsman of all time, as well as the third greatest Test batsman of all time, after Sir Don Bradman and Sachin Tendulkar. Richards was voted one of the five Cricketers of the Century by a 100-member panel of experts in 2000, along with Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers, Sir Jack Hobbs and Shane Warne.

565,1989,February,14,Robin Givens is granted a divorce from Mike Tyson in the Dominican Republic,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_O%27Hara,"Maureen O'Hara (born Maureen FitzSimons; 17 August 1920 – 24 October 2015) was an American and Irish actress and singer. She was a famous redhead who was known for playing fiercely passionate, but sensible heroines, often in westerns and adventure films. On numerous occasions, she worked with director John Ford and longtime friend John Wayne. O'Hara was one of the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood.
O'Hara grew up in Dublin in a Catholic family and aspired to become an actress from a very young age. She trained with the Rathmines Theatre Company from the age of 10 and at the Abbey Theatre from the age of 14. She was given a screen test, which was deemed unsatisfactory, but Charles Laughton saw potential and arranged for her to co-star with him in Alfred Hitchcock's Jamaica Inn in 1939. She moved to Hollywood the same year to appear with him in the production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and was given a contract by RKO Pictures. From there, she went on to enjoy a long and highly successful career, and acquired the nickname ""The Queen of Technicolor"".
She appeared in films such as How Green Was My Valley (1941) (her first collaboration with John Ford), The Black Swan with Tyrone Power (1942), The Spanish Main (1945), Sinbad the Sailor (1947), the Christmas classic Miracle on 34th Street (1947) with John Payne and Natalie Wood, and Comanche Territory (1950).
O'Hara made her first film with John Wayne, the actor with whom she is most closely associated, in Rio Grande (1950). This was followed by The Quiet Man (1952), The Wings of Eagles (1957), McLintock! (1963) and Big Jake (1971). Such was her strong chemistry with Wayne that many assumed they were married or in a relationship.
In the 1960s O'Hara increasingly turned to more motherly roles as she aged, appearing in films such as The Deadly Companions (1961), The Parent Trap (1961) and The Rare Breed (1966). She retired from the industry in 1971 but returned 20 years later to appear with John Candy in Only the Lonely (1991).
In the late 1970s, O'Hara helped run her third husband Charles F.

Included are people who changed their legal names and people who created personal or professional pseudonyms. Under longstanding Western custom and law, children are customarily given the father's surname, except for children born outside marriage, who often carry their mother's family names. In mediaeval times where a great family died out in the male line, an alternative male heir to the estates was selected as one of the younger sons of a daughter, who was required by the bequest to adopt, by royal licence, in lieu of his patronymic, his maternal surname and coat of arms for himself and his descendants. This was also the origin of double-barrelled surnames, where the paternal surname was partially retained, or resurrected by a later generation. The compliance with the terms of the bequest was essential to avoid challenge by another potential heir in the lawcourts. In the 1970s some women began to adopt their mother's maiden name as their legal surnames. People in Sweden have recently begun adopting maternal line surnames in an effort to broaden the number of last names in the country. Such practices add considerable difficulties to the study of genealogy and family history.","{2051, 387, 900, 3978, 3979, 1678, 3862, 1177, 5019, 33, 2210, 4134, 3243, 4526, 563, 2483, 4661, 4024, 3524, 1739, 4430, 2000, 4051, 4307, 3413, 3803, 2141, 1888, 1890, 3812, 3813, 873, 4971, 1388, 1646, 1136, 2039, 2682, 2171, 892, 127}",41,"['Jane Fonda &', 'Tom Hayden', '16 years', 'the 1970s', 'Sweden']","['ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE']"

568,1990,February,11,Nelson Mandela released after 27 years imprisonment in South Africa,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela,"Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (; Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla]; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.
A Xhosa, Mandela was born to the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following the Rivonia Trial.
Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison, and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term, and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.
Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the far-left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honours—including the Nobel Peace Prize—and became the subject of a cult of personality. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name, Madiba, and described as the ""Father of the Nation"".",{4736},1,"['Nelson Mandela', '27 years', 'South Africa', 'Nelson Rolihlahla', 'Mandela', 'Xhosa', '18 July 1918', '5 December 2013', 'South African', 'South Africa', '1994 to 1999', 'African', 'the African National Congress', 'ANC', '1991 to 1997', 'Mandela', 'Thembu', 'Mvezo', 'Union of South Africa', 'the University of Fort Hare', 'the University of Witwatersrand', 'Johannesburg', 'African', 'ANC', '1943', 'Youth League', '1944', ""the National Party's"", 'ANC', 'Mandela', 'ANC', 'Transvaal', '1952', 'Defiance Campaign', '1955', 'Congress of the People', '1956', 'Treason Trial', 'South African', 'SACP', 'Umkhonto', 'Sizwe', '1961', '1962', 'Mandela', '27 years', 'Robben Island', 'Pollsmoor Prison', 'Victor Verster Prison', 'F.

569,1990,April,25,Hubble space telescope is placed into orbit by shuttle Discovery,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope,"The Hubble Space Telescope (often referred to as HST or Hubble) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation. It was not the first space telescope but it is one of the largest and most versatile, well known both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy. The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope.Hubble features a 2.4-meter (7.9 ft) mirror, and its four main instruments observe in the ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as determining the rate of expansion of the universe.
The Hubble telescope was built by the United States space agency NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the Goddard Space Flight Center controls the spacecraft. Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923. Hubble was funded in the 1970s with a proposed launch in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the 1986 Challenger disaster. It was finally launched by Space Shuttle Discovery in 1990, but its main mirror had been ground incorrectly, resulting in spherical aberration that compromised the telescope's capabilities. The optics were corrected to their intended quality by a servicing mission in 1993.
Hubble is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts. Five Space Shuttle missions have repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the main instruments. The fifth mission was canceled on safety grounds following the Columbia disaster (2003), but NASA administrator Michael D. Griffin approved the fifth servicing mission which was completed in 2009. The telescope is operating as of 2020, and could last until 2030–2040. Its successor is the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) which is scheduled to be launched in March 2021.","{1090, 3139, 580, 4547, 2104, 586, 843, 176, 3578, 375, 632, 2137, 3322, 1979, 3612, 4477, 703}",17,"['Discovery', 'The Hubble Space Telescope', 'HST', 'Hubble', 'Earth', '1990', 'Hubble', 'Edwin Hubble', 'NASA', 'Great Observatories', 'Compton', 'the Spitzer Space Telescope', 'Hubble', 'Earth', 'Hubble', 'Hubble', 'United States', 'NASA', 'the European Space Agency', 'The Space Telescope Science Institute', 'Hubble', 'the Goddard Space Flight Center', 'as early as 1923', 'the 1970s', '1983', '1986', 'Challenger', 'Space Shuttle Discovery', '1990', '1993', 'Columbia', '2003', 'NASA', 'Michael D.

Based on the total of the individual national reports cited in the table below (nationalities of victims), at least 2,431 people died. The government of Saudi Arabia officially reported two days after the event that there had been 769 deaths and 934 injured.

The largest number of victims was from Iran, followed by Mali and Nigeria.The crush took place in Mina at the intersection of streets 204 and 223 leading up to Jamaraat Bridge. The cause of the disaster remains in dispute. The Mina disaster inflamed tensions between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, which were already elevated due to the wider turmoil in the Middle East, such as the Syrian Civil War and Yemeni Civil War.

On 2 August 1990 the Iraqi Army invaded and occupied Kuwait, which was met with international condemnation and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the UN Security Council. Together with the UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher, American President George H. W. Bush deployed US forces into Saudi Arabia, and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the coalition, forming the largest military alliance since World War II. The great majority of the coalition's military forces were from the US, with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia paid around US$32 billion of the US$60 billion cost.The war marked the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle, principally by the US network CNN.The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial and naval bombardment on 17 January 1991, continuing for five weeks. This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February. This was a decisive victory for the coalition forces, who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory. The coalition ceased its advance and declared a ceasefire 100 hours after the ground campaign started. Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and areas on Saudi Arabia's border. Iraq launched Scud missiles against coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against Israel.","{7, 2568, 521, 3083, 528, 4113, 3090, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1058, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 3630, 1584, 2104, 1081, 4671, 3139, 580, 1622, 2649, 4192, 2152, 1649, 3195, 2171, 640, 2176, 131, 2703, 144, 3727, 154, 4768, 3234, 2213, 703, 2241, 3777, 717, 4307, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3303, 4330, 748, 1783, 1272, 3322, 1275, 3842, 771, 1795, 1292, 4879, 1808, 4895, 294, 1319, 4905, 4400, 311, 1341, 3903, 1857, 3908, 2891, 4940, 4941, 4942, 2388, 4437, 1888, 1386, 4971, 4472, 889, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 3459, 2955, 3979, 401, 5010, 3999, 3490, 5033, 5059, 452, 964, 5065, 5067, 2508, 1997, 4558, 5077, 5079, 3034, 478, 1502, 492, 3564, 5107, 2040, 3578, 4605}",112,"['US', 'Saudi Arabia', 'The Gulf War', '2 August 1990', 'February 1991', '2 August 1990', 'January 1991', 'Saudi Arabia', '17 January 1991', 'February 1991', 'the United States', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Kuwait', '2 August 1990', 'the Iraqi Army', 'Kuwait', 'Iraq', 'the UN Security Council', 'UK', 'Margaret Thatcher', 'American', 'George H.

575,1990,August,25,UN security council authorizes military action against Iraq,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Kuwait,"The invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 was a two-day operation conducted by Iraq against the neighboring State of Kuwait, which resulted in the seven-month-long Iraqi occupation of the country. This invasion and Iraq's subsequent refusal to withdraw from Kuwait by a deadline mandated by the United Nations led to military intervention by a United Nations-authorized coalition of forces led by the United States. These events came to be known as the first Gulf War and resulted in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the Iraqis setting 600 Kuwaiti oil wells on fire during their retreat.
In early 1990 Iraq was accusing Kuwait of stealing Iraqi petroleum through slant drilling, although some Iraqi sources indicated Saddam Hussein's decision to attack Kuwait was made a few months before the actual invasion. Some feel there were several reasons for the Iraqi move, including Iraq's inability to pay the more than US$14 billion that it had borrowed to finance the Iran–Iraq War, and Kuwaiti high petroleum production levels which kept revenues down for Iraq. The invasion started on 2 August 1990, and within two days most of the Kuwait Armed Forces were either overrun by the Iraqi Republican Guard or fell back to neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Iraq set up a puppet government known as the ""Republic of Kuwait"" to rule over Kuwait and then annexed it outright, when Saddam Hussein announced a few days later that it was the 19th province of Iraq.","{1027, 1036, 14, 1555, 1557, 4123, 1058, 3110, 4134, 4647, 4138, 1583, 2095, 2104, 4671, 2122, 4682, 3154, 3666, 1622, 2647, 606, 1633, 98, 3174, 2152, 3690, 1649, 3185, 3186, 2169, 2170, 2171, 2684, 4221, 640, 1153, 2177, 1162, 3722, 4235, 654, 2703, 144, 3727, 1170, 4756, 2713, 4768, 2215, 680, 1192, 3752, 4775, 3252, 1207, 4798, 1729, 1730, 3777, 1732, 3268, 4802, 3272, 718, 208, 3795, 4307, 1752, 730, 4315, 1244, 1757, 1248, 4832, 1251, 3301, 2278, 2793, 234, 747, 2794, 1780, 4853, 4342, 248, 257, 1288, 4874, 271, 272, 273, 794, 4895, 290, 803, 3879, 4905, 4395, 4915, 310, 2875, 4413, 3903, 325, 1861, 4937, 2379, 847, 2896, 2388, 2901, 3932, 355, 875, 1388, 4971, 2415, 1908, 4981, 4474, 4993, 3970, 4994, 900, 2955, 912, 1424, 3989, 3994, 418, 3495, 4016, 437, 1979, 4539, 452, 453, 964, 965, 4549, 971, 2507, 2004, 5077, 990, 3040, 2018, 4579, 1508, 2536, 2026, 4589, 494, 1526, 2040, 1017, 3578, 4605}",159,"['UN', 'Iraq', 'Kuwait', '2 August 1990', 'two-day', 'Iraq', 'State of Kuwait', 'seven-month-long', 'Iraqi', 'Iraq', 'Kuwait', 'the United Nations', 'United Nations', 'the United States', 'Gulf War', 'Iraqi', 'Kuwait', 'Iraqis', 'early 1990', 'Iraq', 'Kuwait', 'Iraqi', 'Iraqi', ""Saddam Hussein's"", 'Kuwait', 'a few months', 'Iraqi', 'Iraq', 'Iran', 'Iraq', '2 August 1990', 'two days', 'the Kuwait Armed Forces', 'the Iraqi Republican Guard', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Bahrain', 'Iraq', 'the ""Republic of Kuwait', 'Kuwait', 'Saddam Hussein', 'a few days later', 'the 19th province of', 'Iraq']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE']"
576,1990,September,20,Both East and West Germany ratify reunification,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification,"German reunification (German: Deutsche Wiedervereinigung) was the process in 1990 in which the German Democratic Republic (GDR, colloquially East Germany; German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik/DDR) became part of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, colloquially West Germany; German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland/BRD) to form the reunited nation of Germany, as provided by Article 23 of the FRG's then constitution (Grundgesetz). The end of the unification process is officially referred to as German unity (German: Deutsche Einheit), celebrated each year on 3 October as German Unity Day (German: Tag der deutschen Einheit). Berlin was reunited into a single city, and was once again designated as the capital of united Germany.
The East German government started to falter in May 1989, when the removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria opened a hole in the Iron Curtain. It caused an exodus of thousands of East Germans fleeing to West Germany and Austria via Hungary. The Peaceful Revolution, a series of protests by East Germans, led to the GDR's first free elections on 18 March 1990, and to the negotiations between the GDR and FRG that culminated in a Unification Treaty. Other negotiations between the GDR and FRG and the four occupying powers produced the so-called ""Two Plus Four Treaty"" (Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany) granting full sovereignty to a unified German state, whose two parts were previously bound by a number of limitations stemming from their post-World War II status as occupied regions.
The 1945 Potsdam Agreement had specified that a full peace treaty concluding World War II, including the exact delimitation of Germany's postwar boundaries, required to be ""accepted by the Government of Germany when a government adequate for the purpose is established."" The Federal Republic had always maintained that no such government could be said to have been established until East and West Germany had been united within a free democratic state; but in 1990 a range of opinions continued to be maintained over whether a unified West Germany, East Germany, and Berlin could be said to represent ""Germany as a whole"" for this purpose. The key question was whether a Germany that remained bounded to the east by the Oder–Neisse line could act as a ""united Germany"" in signing the peace treaty without qualification. Under the ""Two Plus Four Treaty"" both the Federal Republic and the Democratic Republic committed themselves and their unified continuation to the principle that their joint pre-1990 boundaries constituted the entire territory that could be claimed by a Government of Germany, and hence that there were no further lands outside those boundaries that were parts of Germany as a whole.
The post-1990 united Germany is not a successor state, but an enlarged continuation of the former West Germany. As such, the enlarged Federal Republic of Germany retained the West German seats in international organizations including the European Community (later the European Union) and NATO, while relinquishing membership in the Warsaw Pact and other international organizations to which only East Germany belonged.

578,1990,December,9,Lech Wałęsa wins Poland's 1st direct presidential election in Poland,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland,"Poland (Polish: Polska [ˈpɔlska] (listen)), officially the Republic of Poland (Polish: Rzeczpospolita Polska [ʐɛt͡ʂpɔˈspɔlita ˈpɔlska] (listen)), is a country located in Central Europe. It is divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, covering an area of 312,696 square kilometres (120,733 sq mi), and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With a population of nearly 38.5 million people, Poland is the fifth most populous member state of the European Union. Poland's capital and largest metropolis is Warsaw. Other major cities include Kraków, Łódź, Wrocław, Poznań, Gdańsk, and Szczecin.
Poland is bordered by the Baltic Sea, Lithuania, and Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast to the north, Belarus and Ukraine to the east, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south, and Germany to the west.
The history of human activity on Polish soil spans almost 500,000 years. Throughout the Iron Age the area became extensively diverse, with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain. However, it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name. The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to AD 966, when Mieszko I, ruler of the realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland, converted to Christianity. The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025, and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin. This union formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, one of the largest (over 1,000,000 square kilometres – 400,000 square miles) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe, with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe's first written national constitution, the Constitution of 3 May 1791.
With the passing of prominence and prosperity, the country was partitioned by neighbouring states at the end of the 18th century, and regained its independence in 1918 with the Treaty of Versailles. After a series of territorial conflicts, the new multi-ethnic Poland restored its position as a key player in European politics. In September 1939, World War II started with the invasion of Poland by Germany, followed by the Soviet Union invading Poland in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Around six million  Polish citizens, including 90% of the country's Jews, perished in the war. In 1947, the Polish People's Republic was established as a satellite state under Soviet influence. In the aftermath of the Revolutions of 1989, most notably through the emergence of the Solidarity movement, Poland reestablished itself as a presidential democratic republic.
Poland has a developed market and is a regional power in Central Europe, with the largest stock exchange in the East-Central European zone. It has the sixth largest economy by GDP (nominal) in the European Union and the tenth largest in all of Europe. It's one of the most dynamic economies in the world, simultaneously achieving a very high rank on the Human Development Index. Poland is a developed country, which maintains a high-income economy along with very high standards of living, life quality, safety, education, and economic freedom. Alongside a developed educational system, the state also provides free university education, social security, and a universal health care system. The country has 16 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 15 of which are cultural.Poland is a member state of the Schengen Area, the United Nations, NATO, the OECD, the Three Seas Initiative, the Visegrád Group, and guested at the G20.",set(),0,"['Lech Wałęsa', 'Poland', 'Poland', 'Poland', 'Polish', 'Polska', 'the Republic of Poland', 'Polish', 'Rzeczpospolita Polska', 'Central Europe', 'Poland', 'the European Union', 'Poland', 'metropolis', 'Warsaw', 'Kraków', 'Łódź', 'Wrocław', 'Poznań', 'Gdańsk', 'Szczecin', 'Poland', 'the Baltic Sea', 'Lithuania', 'Russia', 'Kaliningrad Oblast', 'Belarus', 'Ukraine', 'Slovakia', 'the Czech Republic', 'Germany', 'Polish', 'almost 500,000 years', 'Central European', 'the Western Polans', 'Poland', 'Polish', 'Mieszko', 'present-day', 'Poland', 'Christianity', 'The Kingdom of Poland', '1025', '1569', 'Lithuania', 'the Union of Lublin', 'Polish', 'Lithuanian Commonwealth', '16th and 17th century', 'Europe', 'Europe', 'the Constitution of 3 May 1791', 'the end of the 18th century', '1918', 'the Treaty of Versailles', 'Poland', 'European', 'September 1939', 'World War II', 'Poland', 'Germany', 'the Soviet Union', 'Poland', 'Polish', '90%', 'Jews', '1947', 'Polish', 'Soviet', '1989', 'Solidarity', 'Poland', 'Poland', 'Central Europe', 'the East-Central European zone', 'the European Union', 'Europe', 'Poland', 'UNESCO World Heritage Sites', 'Poland', 'the Schengen Area', 'the United Nations', 'NATO', 'OECD', 'the Visegrád Group', 'G20']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERCENT', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE']"

581,1990,April,8,"""Twin Peaks"" created by David Lynch and starring Kyle MacLachlan premieres on ABC-TV",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks,"Twin Peaks is an American mystery horror drama television series created by Mark Frost and David Lynch that premiered on April 8, 1990, on ABC, running until its cancellation after its second season in 1991. The show gained a devoted cult following and has been referenced in a wide variety of media. In subsequent years, Twin Peaks is often listed among the greatest television series of all time, and is considered a landmark turning point in television drama.The series follows an investigation headed by FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) and local Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean) into the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) in the fictional town of Twin Peaks, Washington. The show's narrative draws on elements of detective fiction, but its uncanny tone, supernatural elements, and campy, melodramatic portrayal of eccentric characters also draw on American soap opera and horror tropes. Like much of Lynch's work, it is distinguished by surrealism, offbeat humor, and distinctive cinematography. The score was composed by Angelo Badalamenti with Lynch.The success of the show sparked a media franchise, and the series was followed by a 1992 feature film, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, that serves as a prequel to the series. Additional tie-in books were also released. Following a hiatus of over 25 years, the show returned in 2017 with a third season on Showtime, marketed as Twin Peaks: The Return and Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series. The season was directed by Lynch and written by Lynch and Frost, and starred many original cast members, including MacLachlan.","{4611, 2051, 7, 2568, 4134, 1576, 4661, 4671, 2112, 595, 2141, 620, 1646, 1136, 1139, 2169, 2682, 127, 1678, 1177, 1709, 176, 4785, 690, 2740, 703, 2241, 1739, 1228, 4307, 3803, 4829, 3812, 3813, 748, 3322, 3842, 1795, 3862, 290, 1319, 815, 4920, 826, 1357, 4430, 2388, 4437, 1888, 1890, 4967, 873, 4971, 1388, 3954, 889, 3451, 892, 387, 3459, 3978, 3979, 3989, 1432, 4007, 5033, 4526, 2483, 4024, 2489, 1987, 3524, 1990, 967, 2507, 2508, 4558, 4051, 4589}",79,"['Twin Peaks', 'David Lynch', 'Kyle MacLachlan', 'ABC-TV', 'Twin Peaks', 'American', 'Mark Frost', 'David Lynch', 'April 8, 1990', 'ABC', 'its second season in 1991', 'subsequent years', 'Twin Peaks', 'FBI', 'Dale Cooper', 'Kyle MacLachlan', 'Harry S.

Its music incorporates a range of contemporary genres with a mix of slow ballads and up-tempo tracks. Originally, Carey wrote four songs with Ben Margulies, which solely constituted her demo tape. After Carey was signed to Columbia, all four songs, after being altered and partially re-recorded, made the final cut for the album. Aside from Margulies, Carey worked with a range of professional writers and producers, all of whom were hired by Columbia CEO, Tommy Mottola. Mariah Carey featured production and writing from Rhett Lawrence, Ric Wake and Narada Michael Walden, all of whom were top record producers at the time. Together with Carey, they conceived the album and reconstructed her original demo tape.
Reviews of the album generally complimented Carey's voice and technique, but were ambivalent towards the songwriting. It nonetheless became a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart for 11 consecutive weeks. Mariah Carey was certified nine-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of nine million copies in the United States. The album experienced similar success in Canada, where it topped the charts and was certified seven times Platinum. Mariah Carey fared well in other worldwide territories, reaching the top ten in the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and United Kingdom. Worldwide, the album has sold more than 15 million copies.
Five singles were released from the album, four of which became number-one hits on the Hot 100. ""Vision of Love"" was chosen as the album's lead single, topping the charts in Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. The song was critically lauded, and is regarded as one of the strongest debut singles by a female artist. The album's second single, ""Love Takes Time"" was also well received and topped the charts in Canada and the US. With the following two singles, ""Someday"" and ""I Don't Wanna Cry"" reaching number one in the US, Carey became the first artist since The Jackson 5 to have their first four singles top the charts in the United States.","{1378, 4741}",2,"['Mariah Carey', 'Mariah Carey', 'Mariah Carey', 'American', 'Mariah Carey', 'June 12, 1990', 'Columbia Records', 'Carey', 'Ben Margulies', 'Carey', 'Columbia', 'Carey', 'Columbia', 'Tommy Mottola', 'Mariah Carey', 'Rhett Lawrence', 'Ric Wake', 'Narada Michael Walden', 'Carey', 'Carey', 'Billboard 200', '11 consecutive weeks', 'Mariah Carey', 'the Recording Industry Association of America', 'RIAA', 'the United States', 'Canada', 'Mariah Carey', 'Netherlands', 'Australia', 'New Zealand', 'Norway', 'Sweden', 'United Kingdom', 'Canada', 'New Zealand', 'the United States', 'Love Takes Time', 'Canada', 'US', ""I Don't Wanna Cry"", 'US', 'Carey', 'The Jackson 5', 'the United States']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE']"

The trio began their collaboration with a performance at the ancient Baths of Caracalla in Rome, Italy on 7 July 1990, the eve of the 1990 FIFA World Cup Final. The image of three tenors in formal evening dress singing in a World Cup concert captivated the global audience. The recording of this debut concert became the best-selling classical album of all time and led to additional performances and live albums. They performed to a global television audience at three further World Cup Finals, 1994 in Los Angeles, 1998 in Paris, and 2002 in Yokohama. They also toured other cities around the world, usually performing in stadiums or similar large arenas to huge audiences. They last performed together at an arena in Columbus, Ohio, on 28 September 2003.
The Three Tenors repertoire ranged from opera to Broadway to Neapolitan songs and pop hits. The group's signature songs included ""Nessun dorma"" from Puccini's opera Turandot, usually sung by Pavarotti, and the ballad ""O Sole Mio"", which all three tenors typically sang together.","{636, 258, 392, 1929, 394, 1547, 1676, 2196, 790, 4510, 1056, 2856, 683, 1199, 1844, 1593, 953, 5051, 316, 705, 2625, 4677, 1991, 1482, 2768, 1880, 984, 2264, 4063, 3430, 4841, 1005, 2417, 3444, 2172}",35,"['First Three Tenors', 'Plácido Domingo', 'José Carreras', 'Luciano Pavarotti', 'Baths of Caracalla', 'Rome', 'the 1990s', 'early 2000s', 'Spaniards Plácido Domingo', 'José Carreras', 'Italian', 'Luciano Pavarotti', 'Baths of Caracalla', 'Rome', 'Italy', '7 July 1990', 'the eve of the', '1990', 'FIFA World Cup Final', 'World Cup', 'World Cup Finals', '1994', 'Los Angeles', '1998', 'Paris', '2002', 'Yokohama', 'Columbus', 'Ohio', '28 September 2003', 'Broadway', 'Neapolitan', 'Nessun', 'Puccini', 'Turandot', 'Pavarotti', 'O Sole Mio']","['ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART']"

He is widely considered to be one of the greatest golfers of all time. Over a quarter-century, he won a record 18 major championships, three more than second-placed Tiger Woods. Nicklaus focused on the major championships—Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, Open Championship and PGA Championship—and played a selective schedule of regular PGA Tour events. He competed in 164 major tournaments, more than any other player, and finished with 73 PGA Tour victories, third behind Sam Snead (82) and Woods (82).
Nicklaus won the U.S. Amateur in 1959 and 1961 and finished second in the 1960 U.S. Open, two shots behind Arnold Palmer. Nicklaus turned professional at age 21 toward the end of 1961. He earned his first professional victory at the 1962 U.S. Open, defeating Palmer by three shots in a next-day 18-hole playoff and launching a rivalry between golf superstars. In 1966, Nicklaus became the first player to win the Masters Tournament two years running; he also won The Open Championship, becoming at age 26 the youngest player to win all four golf majors. He won another Open Championship in 1970.Between 1971 and 1980, he won nine more major championships, overtook Bobby Jones' record of 13 majors, and became the first player to complete double and triple career grand slams. He won the 1986 Masters, his 18th and final major championship at age 46, the tournament's oldest winner. Nicklaus joined the Senior PGA Tour (now known as the PGA Tour Champions)  when he became eligible in January 1990, and by April 1996 had won 10 tournaments, including eight major championships despite playing a very limited schedule. He continued to play at least some of the four regular Tour majors until 2005, when he made his final appearances at the Masters Tournament and The Open Championship.
Today Nicklaus heads one of the world's largest golf course design companies. Among his courses is Harbour Town Golf Links. He is a member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects. Nicklaus runs an event on the PGA Tour, the Memorial Tournament.
Nicklaus' books vary from instructional to autobiographical, with his Golf My Way considered one of the best instructional golf books of all time; the video of the same name is the best-selling golf instructional to date.","{4611, 2051, 6, 2568, 2058, 2069, 1559, 1562, 4123, 33, 1569, 4643, 550, 4134, 1576, 3625, 1066, 1583, 561, 563, 4661, 2122, 4174, 4688, 595, 2131, 2141, 3167, 1633, 3682, 3180, 1133, 1646, 1136, 1649, 3186, 1653, 2169, 640, 1153, 4235, 1678, 2703, 3727, 1177, 1183, 4255, 2721, 2210, 4768, 188, 4800, 3268, 2245, 202, 1739, 1740, 4815, 3795, 4307, 3803, 1251, 3299, 1765, 3812, 744, 2793, 2794, 748, 3833, 3834, 3322, 257, 1795, 1288, 1804, 269, 273, 1299, 3862, 287, 290, 3877, 1830, 1319, 4905, 4400, 2865, 310, 1847, 826, 2875, 4413, 2878, 3909, 1865, 4430, 2896, 1372, 861, 1888, 1890, 2916, 870, 874, 1388, 2415, 1908, 889, 4474, 3451, 892, 4990, 895, 4480, 3457, 386, 387, 1925, 1414, 391, 903, 5003, 3468, 1432, 3489, 418, 4518, 423, 4007, 5033, 4526, 2483, 4024, 1466, 452, 3524, 1990, 967, 4549, 971, 2507, 2509, 5077, 4568, 2018, 1508, 3049, 2026, 1526, 2039, 504, 4601}",153,"['Jack Nicklaus', 'the Senior PGA Tour', 'The Tradition at Desert Mountain', 'Gary Player', 'Jack William Nicklaus', 'January 21, 1940', 'The Golden Bear', 'American', 'quarter-century', 'Tiger Woods', 'Nicklaus', 'Masters Tournament', 'U.S.', 'PGA Tour', 'PGA Tour', 'Sam Snead', 'Woods', 'Nicklaus', 'the U.S. Amateur', '1959', '1961', '1960', 'U.S. Open', 'Arnold Palmer', 'Nicklaus', 'age 21', 'the end of 1961', '1962', 'U.S. Open', 'Palmer', 'a next-day', '1966', 'Nicklaus', 'two years', 'The Open Championship', 'age 26', '1970.Between 1971 and 1980', ""Bobby Jones'"", '1986', 'age 46', 'Nicklaus', 'the Senior PGA Tour', 'the PGA Tour Champions', 'January 1990', 'April 1996', 'Tour', '2005', 'the Masters Tournament and The Open Championship', 'Today', 'Nicklaus', 'the American Society of Golf Course Architects', 'Nicklaus', 'the PGA Tour', 'the Memorial Tournament', 'Nicklaus']","['PERSON', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'PERSON']"

They compete in the National Hockey League (NHL)  as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference.
The Oilers were officially founded in 1971 by W. D. ""Wild Bill"" Hunter and Dr. Chuck Allard. The team played its first season in 1972, as one of the twelve founding franchises of the major professional World Hockey Association (WHA). They were originally intended to be one of two WHA Alberta teams, along with the Calgary Broncos. However, when the Broncos relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, before the WHA's first season began, the Oilers were renamed the Alberta Oilers. They returned to their current name in the following year, and subsequently joined the NHL in 1979 as one of four franchises absorbed through the NHL merger with the WHA.
After joining the NHL, the Oilers went on to win the Stanley Cup on five occasions: 1983–84, 1984–85, 1986–87, 1987–88 and 1989–90. Along with the Pittsburgh Penguins, they are tied for the most championships won by any team since the NHL-WHA merger and also the most won by any team that joined the league in or after 1967. Among all NHL teams, only the Montreal Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup more times since the League's 1967 expansion. For their success in the 1980s, the Oilers team of this era has been honoured with dynasty status by the Hockey Hall of Fame.However, the Oilers began to struggle greatly shortly after the 2004–05 NHL lockout, having missed the playoffs every year since 2006, with the exception of 2016–17. The Oilers have drafted 12 first round selections since 2007, 10 of which were within the first 10 draft choices overall, 6 of those picks were within the first 4 picks overall, and 4 of those 6 were first overall selections. In the NHL Entry Draft, Edmonton selected first overall Taylor Hall, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Nail Yakupov and Connor McDavid with those picks; only McDavid and Nugent-Hopkins remain with the Oilers today.
The Oilers are one of two NHL franchises based in Alberta; the other being the Calgary Flames.

589,1990,July,7,"Wimbledon Women's Tennis: Martina Navratilova wins her record 9th Wimbledon singles title beating American Zina Garrison 6-4, 6-1",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Navratilova,"Martina Navratilova (Czech: Martina Navrátilová pronounced [mar'cɪna navˈraːcɪlovaː]; born Martina Šubertová pronounced [ˈmarcɪna ˈʃubɛrtovaː]; October 18, 1956) is a Czechoslovak-born American former professional tennis player and coach. In 2005, Tennis magazine selected her as the greatest female tennis player for the years 1975 through 2005 and she is considered one of the best female tennis players of all time.Navratilova was world No. 1 for a total of 332 weeks in singles, and a record 237 weeks in doubles, making her the only player in history to have held the top spot in both singles and doubles for over 200 weeks. She was year-end singles No. 1 seven times, including a record of five consecutive years, as well as year-end doubles No. 1 five times, including three consecutive years during which she held the ranking for the entire year.
She won 18 Grand Slam singles titles, 31 major women's doubles titles (an all-time record), and 10 major mixed doubles titles, for a combined total of 59 major titles, marking the Open Era record for the most Grand Slam titles won by one player, male or female. She reached the Wimbledon singles final 12 times, including for nine consecutive years from 1982 through 1990, and won the women's singles title at Wimbledon a record nine times (surpassing Helen Wills Moody's eight Wimbledon titles), including a run of six consecutive titles, widely regarded as the best performance by any professional player at a major event. She and Billie Jean King each won 20 combined Wimbledon titles, an all-time record. Navratilova is also one of just three women ever to have accomplished a Career Grand Slam in women's singles and doubles, and mixed doubles, called the career ""Grand Slam Boxed Set""; consisting of every senior Grand Slam title, a distinction she shares only with two others, Margaret Court and Doris Hart.
Navratilova holds the records for most singles (167) and doubles titles (177) in the Open Era. Her record as No. 1 in singles (1982–86) remains the most dominant in professional tennis to date. Over five consecutive seasons, she won 428 out of 442 singles matches, averaging fewer than three losses per year to 87 wins, for a sustained winning percentage of 96.8%. She holds the best season win-loss record in the Open Era, 86-1 (98.9%) in 1983, and four out of the top six Open Era seasons. She recorded the longest winning streak in the Open Era (74 consecutive matches) as well as three out of the six longest winning streaks in history.
She and Serena Williams are the only Open Era players to have won six major singles crowns without the loss of a set. Navratilova, Margaret Court and Maureen Connolly share the record for the most consecutive major singles titles (six). Navratilova reached 11 consecutive major singles finals, second all-time only to Steffi Graf's 13, and is the only woman ever to reach 19 consecutive major semifinals. Navratilova also won the season-ending WTA Tour Championships for top ranked players a record eight times and made the finals a record 14 times. She is the only player of either sex to have won eight different tournaments at least seven times. She was ranked in the world's top 10 in singles for a record 20 consecutive years (1975–1994), a span which included 19 years in the top 5, 15 years in the top 3, and 7 years as the world No. 1 ranked singles player. Navratilova is regarded by many to be the greatest female tennis player of all time.
In women's doubles, Navratilova and Pam Shriver had one of the most successful partnerships in history and won 109 consecutive matches including all four major titles, the doubles Grand Slam, in 1984. The pair set an all-time record of 79 titles together and tied the record set by Louise Brough Clapp and Margaret Osborne duPont of 20 major women's doubles titles as a team. Navratilova also won the WTA Tour Championships doubles title a record 11 times. She is one of only five tennis players of all-time to win a multiple slam set in two disciplines, matched only by Margaret Court, Roy Emerson, Frank Sedgman and Serena Williams. Navratilova won her last major title in 2006, adding the mixed doubles crown at the 2006 US Open to her resume just a few weeks before her 50th birthday, 32 years after her first Grand Slam title in 1974.
Originally from Czechoslovakia, she was stripped of her citizenship when, in 1975 at age 18, she asked the United States for political asylum and was granted temporary residence. At the time, Navratilova was told by the Czechoslovak Sports Federation that she was becoming too Americanized, and she should go back to school and make tennis secondary. Navratilova became a US citizen in 1981, and on January 9, 2008, she reacquired Czech citizenship. She stated she has not renounced her U.S. citizenship nor does she plan to do so, and that reclaiming Czech nationality was not politically motivated.","{1378, 4741}",2,"[""Wimbledon Women's"", 'Martina Navratilova', '9th', 'Wimbledon', 'American', 'Zina Garrison', '6-4', 'Martina Navratilova', 'Czech', 'Martina Navrátilová', 'Martina Šubertová', 'October 18, 1956', 'Czechoslovak', 'American', '2005', 'Tennis', 'the years 1975 through 2005', 'Navratilova', '332 weeks', '237 weeks', 'over 200 weeks', 'year-end', 'five consecutive years', 'year-end', 'three consecutive years', 'the entire year', 'Grand Slam', 'Grand Slam', 'Wimbledon', 'nine consecutive years', 'Wimbledon', ""Helen Wills Moody's"", 'Wimbledon', 'Wimbledon', 'Navratilova', 'a Career Grand Slam', 'Grand Slam Boxed Set', 'Grand Slam', 'Margaret Court', 'Doris Hart', 'singles', '96.8%', 'the best season', 'the Open Era', '98.9%', '1983', 'Serena Williams', 'Open Era', 'Navratilova', 'Margaret Court', 'Maureen Connolly', 'Navratilova', ""Steffi Graf's"", '13', 'Navratilova', 'WTA Tour Championships', '20 consecutive years', '19 years', 'the top 5, 15 years', '7 years', 'Navratilova', 'Navratilova', 'Pam Shriver', 'Grand Slam', '1984', 'Louise Brough Clapp', 'Margaret Osborne duPont', 'Navratilova', 'the WTA Tour Championships', 'Margaret Court', 'Roy Emerson', 'Frank Sedgman', 'Serena Williams', 'Navratilova', '2006', 'the 2006 US Open', 'a few weeks', '32 years', 'Grand Slam', '1974', 'Czechoslovakia', '1975', 'age 18', 'the United States', 'Navratilova', 'the Czechoslovak Sports Federation', 'Navratilova', 'US', '1981', 'January 9, 2008', 'Czech', 'U.S.', 'Czech']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'FAC', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP']"

596,1991,January,17,"Operation Desert Storm begins, with US-led coalition forces bombing Iraq, during the Gulf War",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War_syndrome,"Gulf War syndrome or Gulf War illness is a chronic and multi-symptomatic disorder affecting returning military veterans of the 1990–1991 Persian Gulf War.  A wide range of acute and chronic symptoms have been linked to it, including fatigue, muscle pain, cognitive problems, insomnia, rashes and diarrhea. Approximately 250,000 of the 697,000 U.S. veterans who served in the 1991 Gulf War are afflicted with enduring chronic multi-symptom illness, a condition with serious consequences.From 1995 to 2005, the health of combat veterans worsened in comparison with nondeployed veterans, with the onset of more new chronic diseases, functional impairment, repeated clinic visits and hospitalizations, chronic fatigue syndrome-like illness, posttraumatic stress disorder, and greater persistence of adverse health incidents.Exposure to pesticides and pills containing pyridostigmine bromide (used as a pretreatment to protect against nerve agent effects) has been found to be associated with the neurological effects seen in Gulf war syndrome. Other causes that have been investigated are sarin, cyclosarin, and emissions from oil well fire, but their relationship to the illness is not as clear.Studies have consistently indicated that Gulf War syndrome is not the result of combat or other stressors and that Gulf War veterans have lower rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than veterans of other wars.According to a 2013 report by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, veterans of the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan may also suffer from Gulf War syndrome, though later findings identified causes that would not have been present in those wars.","{4611, 4101, 2568, 521, 4113, 3090, 2589, 2590, 2078, 1573, 4134, 39, 1576, 2601, 4647, 2096, 2104, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4688, 1622, 2649, 3163, 608, 2155, 3693, 1136, 1649, 2169, 2170, 2682, 3195, 640, 2703, 144, 3727, 4758, 4768, 2213, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 3285, 4313, 4825, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3303, 748, 2798, 1275, 4859, 1795, 1808, 4895, 294, 807, 4400, 4916, 311, 1847, 4920, 826, 2875, 3903, 4942, 2388, 4971, 4474, 4993, 3970, 3459, 3460, 1422, 1432, 4007, 5033, 4014, 2995, 4024, 4539, 5059, 4549, 1990, 967, 971, 2507, 1997, 2508, 5074, 5079, 3034, 1502, 3040, 2018, 997, 492, 4589, 5106, 5107, 2040}",106,"['Desert Storm', 'US', 'Iraq', 'the Gulf War', 'Gulf War', 'Gulf War', 'Persian Gulf War', 'U.S.', 'the 1991 Gulf War', '1995 to 2005', 'Gulf war syndrome', 'sarin', 'Gulf War', 'Gulf War', '2013', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'America', 'U.S.', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Gulf War']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT']"

598,1991,February,28,Gulf War ends after Iraq accepts a ceasefire following their retreat from Kuwait,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_uprisings_in_Iraq,"The 1991 uprisings in Iraq, sometimes referred to as the 1991 Iraqi Civil War  were a series of popular rebellions in northern and southern Iraq in March and April 1991 during a ceasefire in the Persian Gulf War. The mostly uncoordinated insurgency, often referred to as the Sha'aban Intifada among Shi'ite Arabs and as the National Uprising among Kurds, was fueled by the perception that then Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had become vulnerable to regime change. This perception of weakness was largely the result of the outcome of two prior wars: the Iran–Iraq War and the invasion of Kuwait, both of which occurred within a single decade and devastated the economy and population of Iraq.
Within the first two weeks, most of Iraq's cities and provinces fell to rebel forces. Participants of the uprising were a diverse mix of ethnic, religious and political affiliations, including military mutineers, Shia Arab Islamists, Kurdish nationalists, and far-left groups. Following initial victories, the revolution was held back from continued success by internal divisions as well as a lack of anticipated American support. Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated Ba'ath Party regime managed to maintain control over the capital of Baghdad and soon largely suppressed the rebels in a brutal campaign conducted by loyalist forces spearheaded by the Iraqi Republican Guard.
During the brief, roughly one-month period of unrest, tens of thousands of people died and nearly two million people were displaced. After the conflict, the Iraqi government intensified a prior systematic forced relocation of Marsh Arabs and the draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes in the Tigris–Euphrates river system. The Persian Gulf War Coalition established Iraqi no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq, and the Kurdish opposition established the Kurdish Autonomous Republic in Iraqi Kurdistan.","{4611, 2052, 7, 2568, 1041, 1557, 1566, 1058, 1576, 1584, 2104, 4157, 4671, 4682, 1616, 595, 1619, 1622, 1121, 2152, 1649, 3185, 2169, 2684, 640, 4235, 2703, 3727, 668, 4768, 2210, 3234, 1703, 2743, 3777, 3795, 4307, 4832, 748, 1272, 3322, 3834, 3842, 1795, 4895, 290, 3365, 1319, 4905, 4400, 1847, 4920, 826, 2875, 4413, 1855, 3908, 4937, 2891, 4437, 4445, 4971, 2924, 3446, 889, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 387, 3459, 4996, 2955, 3468, 3989, 1432, 3999, 4007, 5033, 1979, 4539, 452, 964, 965, 967, 1990, 4549, 971, 2507, 4558, 467, 2004, 4563, 5077, 1502, 2018, 4589, 494, 3578, 4605}",100,"['Gulf War', 'Iraq', 'Kuwait', '1991', 'Iraq', 'the 1991 Iraqi Civil War', 'Iraq', 'March', 'April 1991', 'the Persian Gulf War', ""Shi'ite Arabs"", 'the National Uprising', 'Kurds', 'Iraqi', 'Saddam Hussein', 'Iran', 'Kuwait', 'a single decade', 'Iraq', 'the first two weeks', 'Iraq', 'Shia Arab Islamists', 'Kurdish', 'American', 'Saddam', 'Sunni Arab', ""Ba'ath Party"", 'Baghdad', 'the Iraqi Republican Guard', 'one-month', 'Iraqi', 'Marsh Arabs', 'Mesopotamian', 'Tigris', 'Euphrates river', 'The Persian Gulf War Coalition', 'Iraqi', 'Iraq', 'Kurdish', 'the Kurdish Autonomous Republic', 'Iraqi', 'Kurdistan']","['EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE']"

600,1991,April,29,"Cyclone strikes the Chittagong district in Bangladesh, killing 139,000 people and leaving 10 million homeless",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943,"The Bengal famine of 1943 (Bengali: pônchasher mônnôntôr) was a famine in the Bengal province of British India during World War II. An estimated 2.1–3 million, out of a population of 60.3 million, died of starvation, malaria, or other diseases aggravated by malnutrition, population displacement, unsanitary conditions and lack of health care. Millions were impoverished as the crisis overwhelmed large segments of the economy and catastrophically disrupted the social fabric. Eventually, families disintegrated; men sold their small farms and left home to look for work or to join the army, and women and children became homeless migrants, often travelling to Calcutta or another large city in search of organised relief. Historians have frequently characterised the famine as ""man-made"", asserting that wartime colonial policies created and then exacerbated the crisis. A minority view holds that the famine arose instead from natural causes.Bengal's economy had been predominantly agrarian, with between half and three-quarters of the rural poor subsisting in a ""semi-starved condition"". Stagnant agricultural productivity and a stable land base were unable to cope with a rapidly increasing population, resulting in both long-term decline in per capita availability of rice and growing numbers of the land-poor or landless labourers. A high proportion laboured beneath a chronic and spiralling cycle of debt that ended in debt bondage and the loss of their landholdings due to land grabbing.The financing of military escalation led to war-time inflation, as land was appropriated from thousands of peasants. Many workers received monetary wages rather than payment in kind with a portion of the harvest. When prices rose sharply, their wages failed to follow suit; this drop in real wages left them less able to purchase food. During the Japanese occupation of Burma, many rice imports were lost as the region's market supplies and transport systems were disrupted by British ""denial policies"" for rice and boats (a ""scorched earth"" response to the occupation). The Bengal Chamber of Commerce (composed mainly of British-owned firms), with the approval of the Government of Bengal, devised a Foodstuffs Scheme to provide preferential distribution of goods and services to workers in high-priority roles such as armed forces, war industries, civil servants and other ""priority classes"", to prevent them from leaving their positions. These factors were compounded by restricted access to grain: domestic sources were constrained by emergency inter-provincial trade barriers, while access to international imports was largely denied by Churchill's War Cabinet, arguably due to a wartime shortage of shipping. More proximate causes included large-scale natural disasters in south-western Bengal (a cyclone, tidal waves and flooding, and rice crop disease). The relative importance of each of these factors on the death toll is a matter of controversy.
The provincial government denied that a famine existed, and humanitarian aid was ineffective through the worst months of the crisis. The government first attempted to influence the price of rice paddy, but instead created a black market which encouraged sellers to withhold stocks, leading to hyperinflation from speculation and hoarding after controls were abandoned. Aid increased significantly when the Indian Army took control of funding in October 1943, but effective relief arrived after a record rice harvest that December. Deaths from starvation declined, yet over half the famine-related deaths occurred in 1944, as a result of disease, after the food security crisis had abated.

Eruptive activity began on April 2 as a series of phreatic explosions from a fissure that opened on the north side of Mount Pinatubo. Seismographs were set up and began monitoring the volcano for earthquakes. In late May, the number of seismic events under the volcano fluctuated from day-to-day. Beginning June 6, a swarm of progressively shallower earthquakes accompanied by inflationary tilt on the upper east flank of the mountain, culminated in the extrusion of a small lava dome.On June 12, the volcano’s first spectacular eruption sent an ash column 19 km (12 mi) into the atmosphere. Additional explosions occurred overnight and the morning of June 13. Seismic activity during this period became intense. When even more highly gas-charged magma reached Pinatubo's surface on June 15, the volcano exploded, sending an ash cloud 40 km (25 mi) into the atmosphere. Volcanic ash and pumice blanketed the countryside. Huge pyroclastic flows roared down the flanks of Pinatubo, filling once-deep valleys with fresh volcanic deposits as much as 200 m (660 ft) thick. The eruption removed so much magma and rock from beneath the volcano that the summit collapsed to form a small caldera 2.5 km (1.6 mi) across.Fine ash from the eruption fell as far away as the Indian Ocean and satellites tracked the ash cloud as it traveled several times around the globe. At least 16 commercial jets inadvertently flew through the drifting ash cloud, sustaining about $100 million in damage. With the ashfall came darkness and the sounds of lahars rumbling down the rivers. Several smaller lahars washed through the Clark Air Base, flowing across the base in enormously powerful sheets, slamming into buildings and scattering cars. Nearly every bridge within 30 km (19 mi) of Mount Pinatubo was destroyed. Several lowland towns were flooded or partially buried in mud. More than 840 people were killed from the collapse of roofs under wet heavy ash and several more were injured.Rain continued to create hazards over the next several years, as the volcanic deposits were remobilized into secondary mudflows. Damage to bridges, irrigation-canal systems, roads, cropland and urban areas occurred in the wake of each significant rainfall. Many more people were affected for much longer by rain-induced lahars than by the eruption itself.","{3842, 387, 1668, 900, 2051, 7, 3970, 1802, 523, 2058, 2955, 1678, 4235, 893, 4113, 1938, 3989, 3862, 4758, 3864, 1177, 290, 4134, 4526, 4400, 2483, 3508, 4661, 2682, 1591, 4024, 442, 4413, 1343, 452, 3524, 967, 3528, 1739, 2507, 4430, 4815, 2514, 595, 3154, 2261, 2645, 3666, 4307, 603, 3036, 2141, 3803, 607, 608, 1888, 1890, 889, 3812, 743, 873, 1388, 3180, 1646, 4589, 1136, 370, 4722, 2039, 2169, 3322, 3451, 892, 4605, 127}",75,"['Mount Pinatubo', 'Philippines', 'Earth', 'the 20th century', '1991', 'Mount Pinatubo', 'the Luzon Volcanic Arc', 'the Central Luzon region', 'Philippines', 'April 2', 'Mount Pinatubo', 'late May', 'June 6', 'June 12', 'Pinatubo', 'June 15', 'Pinatubo', 'the Indian Ocean', 'the Clark Air Base', 'Mount Pinatubo', 'the next several years']","['LOC', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'FAC', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'EVENT', 'LOC', 'DATE']"
602,1991,June,19,Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar surrenders to police,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Escobar,"Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (; 1 December 1949 – 2 December 1993) was a Colombian drug lord and narcoterrorist who founded and was the sole leader of the Medellín Cartel. Dubbed ""The King of Cocaine,"" Escobar is the wealthiest criminal in history, having amassed an estimated net worth of US$30 billion by the time of his death—equivalent to $59 billion as of 2019—while his drug cartel monopolized the cocaine trade into the United States in the 1980s and 1990s.Born in Rionegro and raised in Medellín, Escobar studied briefly at Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellín, but left without graduating; he instead began engaging in criminal activity, selling illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, as well as participating in motor vehicle theft. In the early 1970s, he began to work for various drug smugglers, often kidnapping and holding people for ransom.
In 1976, Escobar founded the Medellín Cartel, which distributed powder cocaine, and established the first smuggling routes into the U.S. Escobar's infiltration into the U.S. created exponential demand for cocaine, and by the 1980s, it was estimated Escobar led monthly shipments of 70 to 80 tons of cocaine into the country from Colombia. As a result, he quickly became one of the richest people in the world, but consistently battled rival cartels domestically and abroad, leading to massacres and the murders of police officers, judges, locals, and prominent politicians, making Colombia the murder capital of the world.In the 1982 parliamentary election, Escobar was elected as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives as part of the Liberal Alternative movement. Through this, he was responsible for community projects, such as the construction of houses and football fields, which gained him popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented. However, Escobar was vilified by the Colombian and U.S. governments, who routinely stifled his political ambitions and pushed for his arrest, with Escobar widely believed to have orchestrated the DAS Building and Avianca Flight 203 bombings in retaliation.
In 1991, Escobar surrendered to authorities, and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on a host of charges, but struck a deal of no extradition with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, with the ability of being housed in his own, self-built prison, La Catedral. In 1992, Escobar escaped and went into hiding when authorities attempted to move him to a more standard holding facility, leading to a nation-wide manhunt. As a result, the Medellín Cartel crumbled, and in 1993, Escobar was killed in his hometown by Colombian National Police, a day after his 44th birthday.Escobar's legacy remains controversial; while many denounce the heinous nature of his crimes, he was seen as a ""Robin Hood-like"" figure for many in Colombia, as he provided many amenities to the poor, while his killing was mourned and his funeral attended by over 25,000 people. Additionally, his private estate, Hacienda Nápoles, has been transformed into a theme park, and he has been praised and criticized for importing hippopotamuses to Colombia. His life has also served as inspiration for or has been dramatized in film, television, and in music.","{1153, 3970, 2051, 387, 1414, 1678, 4750, 3862, 1432, 418, 290, 4134, 4007, 1583, 1847, 826, 1990, 967, 202, 1739, 2507, 4430, 5074, 467, 595, 4691, 3803, 2141, 1890, 2018, 3812, 997, 873, 2793, 2794, 1388, 3180, 1646, 2415, 1136}",40,"['Colombian', 'Pablo Escobar', 'December 1949', 'December 1993', 'Colombian', 'the Medellín Cartel', 'The King of Cocaine', 'the United States', 'the 1980s and 1990s', 'Rionegro', 'Medellín', 'Universidad', 'Autónoma', 'Latinoamericana', 'Medellín', 'the early 1970s', '1976', 'the Medellín Cartel', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'the 1980s', 'Escobar', 'monthly', 'Colombia', 'Colombia', '1982', 'Escobar', 'the Chamber of Representatives', 'Liberal Alternative', 'Escobar', 'Colombian', 'U.S.', 'the DAS Building', 'Avianca Flight 203', '1991', ""five years'"", 'Colombian', 'Cesar Gaviria', 'La Catedral', '1992', 'the Medellín Cartel', '1993', 'Escobar', 'Colombian National Police', 'a day', 'Escobar', 'Robin Hood-like', 'Colombia', 'Hacienda Nápoles', 'Colombia']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE']"

605,1991,August,19,Conservative members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union attempt to depose Mikhail Gorbachev in a coup d'état,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union,"The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was the founding and ruling political party of the Soviet Union. The CPSU was the sole governing party of the Soviet Union until 1990, when the Congress of People's Deputies modified Article 6 of the most recent 1977 Soviet constitution, which had granted the CPSU a monopoly over the political system.
The party was founded in 1912 by the Bolsheviks, a majority faction detached from the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, who seized power in the October Revolution of 1917. After 74 years, it was dissolved on 29 August 1991 on Soviet territory, soon after a failed coup d'état by hard-line CPSU leaders against Soviet president and party general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. It was completely outlawed three months later on 6 November 1991 on Russian territory.
The CPSU was a Communist party, organized on the basis of democratic centralism. This principle, conceived by Lenin, entails democratic and open discussion of policy issues within the party followed by the requirement of total unity in upholding the agreed policies. The highest body within the CPSU was the Party Congress, which convened every five years. When the Congress was not in session, the Central Committee was the highest body. Because the Central Committee met twice a year, most day-to-day duties and responsibilities were vested in the Politburo, (previously the Presidium), the Secretariat and the Orgburo (until 1952). The party leader was the head of government and held the office of either General Secretary, Premier or head of state, or some of the three offices concurrently—but never all three at the same time. The party leader was the de facto chairman of the CPSU Politburo and chief executive of the Soviet Union. The tension between the party and the state (Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union) for the shifting focus of power was never formally resolved, but in reality the party dominated and a paramount leader always existed (first Lenin and thereafter the General Secretary).
After the founding of the Soviet Union in 1922, Lenin had introduced a mixed economy, commonly referred to as the New Economic Policy, which allowed for capitalist practices to resume under the Communist Party dictation in order to develop the necessary conditions for socialism to become a practical pursuit in the economically undeveloped country. In 1929, as Joseph Stalin became the leader of the party, Marxism–Leninism, a fusion of the original ideas of German philosopher and economic theorist Karl Marx, and Lenin, became formalized as the party's guiding ideology and would remain so throughout the rest of its existence. The party pursued state socialism, under which all industries were nationalized and a command economy was implemented. After recovering from the Second World War, reforms were implemented which decentralized economic planning and liberalized Soviet society in general under Nikita Khrushchev. By 1980, various factors, including the continuing Cold War, and ongoing nuclear arms race with the United States and other Western European powers and unaddressed inefficiencies in the economy, led to stagnant economic growth under Alexei Kosygin, and further with  Leonid Brezhnev and a growing disillusionment. After the younger, vigorous Mikhail Gorbachev (b. 1931), assumed leadership in 1985, (following two short-term elderly leaders who quickly died in succession), rapid steps were taken to transform the tottering Soviet economic system in the direction of a market economy once again. Gorbachev and his allies envisioned the introduction of an economy similar to Lenin's earlier New Economic Policy through a program of ""perestroika"", or restructuring, but their reforms, along with the institution of free multi-candidate elections led to a decline in the party's power, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the banning of the party by later last RSFSR President Boris Yeltsin and subsequent first President of an evolving democratic and free market economy of the successor Russian Federation.
A number of causes contributed to CPSU's loss of control and the dissolution of the Soviet Union during the early 1990s. Some historians have written that Gorbachev's policy of ""glasnost"" (political openness) was the root cause, noting that it weakened the party's control over society. Gorbachev maintained that perestroika without glasnost was doomed to failure anyway. Others have blamed the economic stagnation and subsequent loss of faith by the general populace in communist ideology. In the final years of the CPSU's existence, the Communist Parties of the federal subjects of Russia were united into the Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). After the CPSU's demise, the Communist Parties of the Union Republics became independent and underwent various separate paths of reform. In Russia, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation emerged and has been regarded as the inheritor of the CPSU's old Bolshevik legacy into the present day.","{1026, 2051, 7, 2568, 524, 1555, 3613, 1566, 2080, 1058, 4134, 1576, 1583, 4661, 2104, 2112, 2119, 2122, 4682, 595, 1622, 2647, 2141, 1633, 2150, 2152, 1646, 1136, 1649, 3190, 2169, 2682, 2171, 3199, 640, 1153, 4736, 127, 1162, 4235, 1678, 2191, 144, 2703, 3727, 663, 1177, 4768, 2210, 1192, 3752, 3243, 684, 1709, 174, 703, 3777, 1739, 1228, 4815, 3795, 4307, 3799, 3803, 1251, 3812, 3813, 2793, 2794, 1783, 3322, 1275, 3842, 3332, 1288, 2322, 3348, 3862, 283, 4895, 1824, 290, 3874, 4905, 1847, 2875, 4413, 830, 2379, 4430, 4944, 2388, 2901, 3413, 2391, 4445, 1888, 1890, 358, 873, 3434, 4971, 1388, 2415, 3951, 889, 890, 3451, 892, 4993, 4994, 387, 2955, 3979, 1938, 3989, 418, 4516, 1960, 2475, 4526, 2483, 4020, 2487, 1979, 4539, 452, 964, 3524, 967, 4549, 971, 2507, 1997, 4051, 2004, 5077, 2525, 1508, 5097, 2026, 4589, 3061, 1526, 2039, 2040, 2555, 4605}",148,"['the Communist Party', 'the Soviet Union', 'Mikhail Gorbachev', 'The Communist Party', 'the Soviet Union', 'CPSU', 'the Soviet Union', 'the Soviet Union', '1990', ""the Congress of People's Deputies"", 'Article 6 of the most recent 1977', 'Soviet', '1912', 'Bolsheviks', 'the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party', 'Vladimir Lenin', 'the October Revolution of 1917', '74 years', '29 August 1991', 'Soviet', 'Soviet', 'Mikhail Gorbachev', 'three months later', 'Russian', 'Communist', 'Lenin', 'CPSU', 'the Party Congress', 'every five years', 'Congress', 'the Central Committee', 'the Central Committee', 'Politburo', 'Presidium', 'Secretariat', 'Orgburo', '1952', 'the CPSU Politburo', 'the Soviet Union', 'Council of Ministers of', 'the Soviet Union', 'Lenin', 'the Soviet Union', '1922', 'Lenin', 'the New Economic Policy', 'Communist Party', '1929', 'Joseph Stalin', 'German', 'Karl Marx', 'Lenin', 'the Second World War', 'Soviet', 'Nikita Khrushchev', '1980', 'Cold War', 'the United States', 'Western European', 'Alexei Kosygin', 'Leonid Brezhnev', 'Mikhail Gorbachev', '1931', '1985', 'Soviet', 'Gorbachev', 'Lenin', 'the Soviet Union', 'RSFSR', 'Boris Yeltsin', 'Russian Federation', 'CPSU', 'the Soviet Union', 'the early 1990s', 'Gorbachev', 'Gorbachev', 'the final years', 'CPSU', 'Russia', 'the Communist Party', 'Federative Socialist Republic', 'Communist', 'Russia', 'the Communist Party', 'the Russian Federation', 'the present day']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE']"
606,1991,August,21,Conservative coup in the Soviet Union is crushed by popular resistance led by Boris Yeltsin in three days,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt,"The 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, also known as the August Coup (Russian: Августовский путч, tr. Avgustovskiy Putch ""August Putsch""), was an attempt made by members of the government of the Soviet Union to take control of the country from Soviet President and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. The coup leaders were hard-line members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) who were opposed to Gorbachev's reform program and the new union treaty that he had negotiated which decentralized much of the central government's power to the republics. They were opposed, mainly in Moscow, by a short but effective campaign of civil resistance led by Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who had been both an ally and critic of Gorbachev. Although the coup collapsed in only two days and Gorbachev returned to power, the event destabilized the USSR and is widely considered to have contributed to both the demise of the CPSU and the dissolution of the USSR.
After the capitulation of the State Committee on the State of Emergency (GKChP), popularly referred to as the ""Gang of Eight"", both the Supreme Court of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev described their actions as a coup attempt.","{1026, 524, 1566, 1058, 4138, 1583, 1584, 2104, 1622, 2647, 3676, 1633, 2152, 1649, 3705, 2169, 2171, 640, 1153, 4736, 3722, 4235, 2703, 144, 3727, 4768, 2210, 680, 1192, 3752, 174, 3252, 703, 4287, 3777, 1730, 1732, 3272, 1228, 2767, 3795, 4307, 730, 1757, 1251, 2278, 2793, 234, 1288, 4895, 3874, 4905, 2875, 4413, 843, 2901, 4971, 2415, 3451, 4993, 4994, 2955, 1424, 418, 4516, 1960, 2487, 452, 453, 964, 4549, 971, 1997, 468, 2004, 5077, 2525, 990, 1508, 2026, 3061, 1526, 2040, 3578, 4605}",85,"['the Soviet Union', 'Boris Yeltsin', 'three days', '1991', 'Soviet', 'the August Coup', 'Russian', 'путч', 'Avgustovskiy Putch', 'August Putsch', 'the Soviet Union', 'Soviet', 'General', 'Mikhail Gorbachev', 'the Communist Party', 'the Soviet Union', 'Gorbachev', 'Moscow', 'Russian', 'Boris Yeltsin', 'Gorbachev', 'only two days', 'Gorbachev', 'USSR', 'CPSU', 'USSR', 'the State Committee on the State of Emergency', 'the ""Gang of Eight', 'the Supreme Court', 'Federative Socialist Republic', 'Soviet', 'Mikhail Gorbachev']","['GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON']"
607,1991,December,21,Soviet Union formally dissolves as 11 of 12 republics sign treaty forming Commonwealth of Independent States,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States,"The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) (Russian: Содружество Независимых Государств, Sodružestvo Nezavisimykh Gosudarstv, initialism: СНГ, SNG) is a regional intergovernmental organization of nine (originally ten) members, plus two founding non-member, post-Soviet republics in Eurasia. It was formed following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. It covers an area of 20,368,759 km² (8,097,484 sq mi) and has an estimated population of 239,796,010. The CIS encourages cooperation in economic, political and military affairs and has certain powers relating to the coordination of trade, finance, lawmaking, and security. It has also promoted cooperation on cross-border crime prevention.
The CIS has its origins in the Russian Empire when it was proclaimed in 1721. After the October Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the leading republic in the Soviet Union (USSR) upon its creation with the 1922 Treaty and Declaration of the Creation of the USSR along with Byelorussian SSR and Ukrainian SSR. When the USSR began to fall in 1991, the founding republics signed the Belavezha Accords on 8 December 1991, declaring that the Soviet Union would cease to exist and proclaimed the CIS in its place.  A few days later the Alma-Ata Protocol was signed, which declared that the Soviet Union was dissolved and that the Russian Federation was to be its successor state.  The Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), which regard their membership in the Soviet Union as an illegal occupation, chose not to participate. Georgia withdrew its membership in 2008. Ukraine ended its participation in CIS statutory bodies on 19 May 2018.Eight of the nine CIS member states participate in the CIS Free Trade Area. Three organizations are under the overview of the CIS, namely the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Union (alongside subdivisions, the Eurasian Customs Union and the Eurasian Economic Space, which comprises territory inhabited by over 180 million people); and the Union State. While the first and the second are military and economic alliances, the third aims to reach a supranational union of Russia and Belarus with a common government, flag, currency and so on.
Several international organizations, human rights groups and outside observers have criticized the CIS and its member states for its repressive human rights abuses, limited civil rights and indefinite imprisonment or execution of political figures and dissidents.",set(),0,"['Soviet Union', 'Commonwealth of Independent States', 'The Commonwealth of Independent States', 'Russian', 'Содружество Независимых Государств', 'Sodružestvo Nezavisimykh Gosudarstv', 'SNG', 'post-Soviet', 'Eurasia', 'the Soviet Union', '1991', 'km²', 'CIS', 'the Russian Empire', '1721', 'the October Revolution', 'Federative Socialist', 'the Soviet Union', 'USSR', 'the 1922 Treaty and Declaration of the Creation of the', 'USSR', 'Byelorussian SSR', 'Ukrainian SSR', 'USSR', '1991', 'the Belavezha Accords', '8 December 1991', 'the Soviet Union', 'A few days later', 'the Alma-Ata Protocol', 'the Soviet Union', 'the Russian Federation', 'Baltic', 'Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania', 'the Soviet Union', 'Georgia', '2008', 'Ukraine', 'CIS', 'the CIS Free Trade Area', 'CIS', 'the Collective Security Treaty Organization', 'the Eurasian Economic Union', 'the Eurasian Customs Union', 'the Eurasian Economic Space', 'the Union State', 'Russia', 'Belarus', 'CIS']","['GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG']"
608,1991,December,25,Mikhail Gorbachev formally resigns as President of USSR in a televised speech,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union,"The dissolution of the Soviet Union, or collapse of the Soviet Union, was the process of internal disintegration within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), also referred to as the Soviet Union, which began in the second half of the 1980s with growing unrest in the national republics and ended on 26 December 1991, when the USSR itself was voted out of existence by the Supreme Soviet, following the Belovezha Accords. Declaration number 142-Н by the Supreme Soviet resulted in self-governing independence to the Republics of the USSR, formally dissolving the USSR. The declaration acknowledged the independence of the former Soviet republics and created the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), although five of the signatories ratified it much later or did not do so at all.
On the previous day, 25 December 1991, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev–the eighth and final leader of the USSR–resigned, declared his office extinct and handed over its powers—including control of the Soviet nuclear missile launching codes—to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. That evening at 7:32 p.m., the Soviet flag was lowered from the Kremlin for the last time and replaced with the pre-revolutionary Russian flag.Previously, from August to December, all the individual republics, including Russia itself, had either seceded from the union or at the very least denounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR. The week before formal dissolution, eleven republics signed the Alma-Ata Protocol formally establishing the CIS and declaring that the USSR had ceased to exist. Both the Revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the USSR also marked the end of the Cold War.
Several of the former Soviet republics have retained close links with the Russian Federation and formed multilateral organizations such as the Commonwealth of Independent States, Eurasian Economic Community, the Union State, the Eurasian Customs Union and the Eurasian Economic Union to enhance economic and security cooperation.

610,1991,March,20,Michael Jackson signs $65M 6 album deal with Sony records,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson,"Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the ""King of Pop"", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest entertainers in the history of music. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.
The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records, and rose to solo stardom with his fifth studio album Off the Wall (1979) during the peak of disco. By the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those for ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""Thriller"" from his sixth studio album Thriller (1982), are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. Their popularity helped propel Jackson and the television channel MTV into prominent highlights of 1980s pop culture. At the 26th Grammy Awards, Thriller won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. Jackson continued to innovate with videos including ""Leave Me Alone"" and ""Smooth Criminal"" from Bad (1987), ""Black or White"" and ""Remember the Time"" from Dangerous (1991), ""Scream"" from HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995) and ""Ghosts"" from the remix album Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix (1997). With songs such as ""Man in the Mirror"", ""Black or White"", ""Heal the World"", ""Earth Song"" and ""They Don't Care About Us"", Jackson's music emphasized racial integration, environmentalism and fighting against prejudice and injustice. Through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance techniques such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His sound and style have influenced artists of various genres.
Starting in the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of court, and Jackson was not indicted. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. In 2009, while preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of sedatives administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray. Fans around the world expressed their grief, and Jackson's public memorial service was broadcast live. In August 2009, the Los Angeles County Coroner ruled that Jackson's death was a homicide, and Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter in February 2010. Nine years later, the documentary Leaving Neverland, which detailed posthumous allegations of child sexual abuse, led to a media backlash against Jackson.
Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide. His albums Off the Wall (1979), Thriller (1982), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995), rank among the best-selling of all time. Thriller is the best-selling album of all time, with estimated sales of 66 million copies worldwide. Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix (1997) is the best-selling remix album of all time. Bad was the first album to produce five Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles. Jackson had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era, and was also the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. He won more awards than any other artist in the history of popular music, has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, and is the only recording artist to have been inducted into the National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame. His other achievements include 39 Guinness World Records, including the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time, 26 American Music Awards, 16 World Music Awards, 13 Grammy Awards, as well as the Grammy Legend and Lifetime Achievement awards, 11 MTV Video Music Awards, 6 Brit Awards, and a Golden Globe Award. In 2016, his estate earned $825 million, the highest yearly amount for a celebrity ever recorded by Forbes.","{4611, 2051, 4101, 7, 1032, 2568, 11, 524, 3601, 4113, 1555, 4643, 4134, 1576, 4661, 568, 2104, 2122, 4682, 4683, 590, 3154, 595, 2645, 1622, 603, 2141, 1646, 1136, 1649, 4722, 2169, 127, 640, 4235, 1678, 2703, 3727, 1683, 1177, 4768, 1706, 174, 4785, 690, 3252, 3777, 1739, 2763, 4815, 3795, 4307, 2261, 3803, 4829, 3812, 3813, 743, 748, 3322, 3842, 1795, 1803, 1806, 1295, 3348, 3862, 3864, 795, 1821, 4895, 290, 3874, 1319, 4905, 810, 815, 4400, 1847, 826, 2875, 4924, 4413, 1343, 2368, 2884, 327, 2891, 1357, 4430, 1873, 2388, 1888, 1890, 4967, 873, 3434, 1388, 3951, 3952, 1907, 1908, 375, 889, 4474, 3451, 892, 893, 4990, 895, 4993, 386, 387, 3459, 3970, 4994, 903, 3978, 2955, 3979, 3989, 1432, 3481, 4518, 4007, 1960, 5033, 4526, 2483, 4020, 4024, 2489, 442, 4539, 1982, 3520, 452, 3524, 1990, 4549, 3528, 971, 2507, 2508, 2509, 2514, 467, 4051, 981, 5077, 2012, 2525, 1502, 3036, 2018, 4589, 4078, 2039, 2040, 2044, 4605}",161,"['Michael Jackson', 'Sony', 'Michael Joseph Jackson', 'August 29, 1958', 'June 25, 2009', 'American', 'the 20th century', 'Jackson', 'four decades', 'Jackson', 'Jackson', '1964', 'Jackie', 'Tito', 'Jermaine', 'Marlon', 'the Jackson 5', 'Jackson', '1971', 'Motown Records', '1979', 'the early 1980s', 'Jackson', 'Billie Jean', 'Thriller', 'album Thriller', '1982', 'Jackson', 'MTV', '1980s', 'Grammy Awards', 'Thriller', 'Grammy Awards', 'Album', 'the Year', 'Jackson', '""Leave Me Alone""', 'Black or White', 'Remember the Time', '1991', 'Scream', 'HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book', '1995', 'Ghosts', 'Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix (1997', 'Man in the Mirror', 'Black or White', 'Heal the World', 'Earth Song', 'Jackson', 'the late 1980s', 'Jackson', '1993', 'Jackson', '2005', '2009', 'Jackson', 'Conrad Murray', 'Jackson', 'August 2009', 'the Los Angeles County Coroner', 'Jackson', 'Murray', 'February 2010', 'Nine years later', 'Leaving Neverland', 'Jackson', 'Jackson', '1979', 'Thriller', '1982', '1987', '1991', '1995', 'Thriller', '1997', 'Jackson', 'the Hot 100 era', 'five different decades', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame', 'the National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame', 'Guinness World Records', 'American Music Awards', 'World Music Awards', 'Grammy Awards', 'the Grammy Legend', 'MTV', 'Golden Globe Award', '2016', 'yearly', 'Forbes']","['PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON']"

612,1991,August,12,"Heavy metal band Metallica release their 5th album ""Metallica"", debuts at No. 1 on Billboard 200 chart",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Chains,"Alice in Chains (often abbreviated as AIC) is an American rock band from Seattle, Washington, formed in 1987 by guitarist and vocalist Jerry Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney, who later recruited bassist Mike Starr and lead vocalist Layne Staley. Starr was replaced by Mike Inez in 1993. William DuVall joined the band in 2006 as co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, replacing Staley, who died in 2002. The band took its name from Staley's previous group, the glam metal band Alice N' Chains.Although widely associated with grunge music, the band's sound incorporates heavy metal elements. Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released six studio albums, three EPs, three live albums, four compilations, two DVDs, 43 music videos, and 32 singles. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals between Staley and Cantrell (and later Cantrell and William DuVall). Cantrell started to sing lead vocals on the 1992 acoustic EP Sap, and his role continued to grow in the following albums, making Alice in Chains a two-vocal band.Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. The band was one of the most successful music acts of the 1990s, selling over 30 million records worldwide, and over 14 million records in the US alone, with two No. 1 albums and six Top 10 albums on the Billboard 200 chart. The band has had 18 Top 10 songs on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, 5 No. 1 hits, and 11 Grammy Award nominations. Their debut album, Facelift, featuring the hit single ""Man in the Box"", was released in 1990 and has been certified double-platinum by the RIAA, selling over two million copies. In 1992, the band's second album, Dirt, was released to critical acclaim and was certified quadruple platinum. Their second acoustic EP, Jar of Flies, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart in 1994, becoming the first ever EP and first Alice in Chains release to top the charts, and it has been certified triple platinum. The band's third album, Alice in Chains debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 1995 and is certified double platinum.Although never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onward, due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band reunited in 2005 for a live benefit show, performing with a number of guest vocalists. They toured in 2006, with William DuVall taking over as lead vocalist full-time. The new line-up released the band's fourth studio album, Black Gives Way to Blue, in 2009, which debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200, received gold certification by the RIAA and two Grammy nominations. The lead single, ""Check My Brain"", became the first Alice in Chains song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 92. Their fifth studio album, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, was released in 2013 and debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. The band toured extensively and released several videos in support of these albums. Alice in Chains' sixth studio album, Rainier Fog, was released in 2018, debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard 200 and received a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album.","{4611, 2568, 524, 528, 4113, 1562, 2589, 2078, 4134, 4647, 1576, 2096, 2628, 2122, 4688, 595, 3671, 3174, 619, 2155, 3180, 1136, 1649, 1653, 2169, 640, 2176, 4736, 131, 136, 2703, 1168, 3727, 4768, 2210, 174, 1711, 2764, 717, 3277, 3795, 4307, 4313, 4825, 3804, 3805, 3303, 748, 2798, 1783, 3322, 1808, 3869, 4895, 290, 3874, 1828, 1319, 4905, 4400, 4916, 309, 311, 1847, 2871, 826, 2875, 3895, 319, 4941, 2391, 3951, 4474, 3451, 4990, 3970, 4994, 3460, 3978, 2955, 5003, 399, 401, 1938, 1432, 3483, 4007, 1960, 4014, 4024, 452, 4549, 967, 5065, 971, 2507, 1997, 2508, 4561, 5077, 3544, 2525, 3040, 2018, 5106, 2040, 4605}",107,"['Metallica', 'Billboard 200', 'Chains', 'AIC', 'American', 'Seattle', 'Washington', '1987', 'Jerry Cantrell', 'Sean Kinney', 'Mike Starr', 'Layne Staley', 'Starr', 'Mike Inez', '1993', 'William DuVall', '2006', 'Staley', '2002', 'Staley', ""Alice N'"", 'Alice', 'Chains', 'Staley', 'Cantrell', 'Cantrell', 'William DuVall', '1992', 'EP Sap', 'Alice', 'Alice', 'Chains', 'the early 1990s', 'Seattle', 'Nirvana', 'Pearl Jam', 'Soundgarden', 'the 1990s', 'US', ""Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks"", 'Grammy Award', 'Facelift', 'Man in the Box', '1990', 'RIAA', '1992', 'Dirt', 'Jar', 'Flies', '1994', 'Alice', 'Chains', 'Alice', 'Chains', '1995', 'Alice', 'Chains', '1996', 'Staley', '2002', '2005', '2006', 'William DuVall', 'Black Gives Way to Blue', '2009', 'RIAA', 'Grammy', 'Check My Brain', 'Alice', 'Chains', 'The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here', '2013', 'Alice', 'Chains', 'Rainier Fog', '2018', 'Best Rock Album']","['DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG']"
613,1991,September,10,"Rock band Nirvana release their single ""Smells like Teen Spirit""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit,"""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" is a song by American rock band Nirvana. It is the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. The unexpected success of the song propelled Nevermind to the top of several albums charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where grunge entered the mainstream.""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" was Nirvana's biggest hit in most countries, charting high on music industry charts around the world in 1991 and 1992, including topping the charts of Belgium, France, New Zealand and Spain. The song received critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll. The song was dubbed an ""anthem for apathetic kids"" of Generation X, but Nirvana grew uncomfortable with the attention it brought them. In the years since Kurt Cobain's death, listeners and critics have continued to praise ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" as one of the greatest songs in the history of music.
The music video for the song is based on the concept of a school concert which ends in anarchy and riot, inspired by Jonathan Kaplan's 1979 film Over the Edge and the Ramones' film Rock 'n' Roll High School. It won two MTV Video Music Awards, which was in heavy rotation on music television. In subsequent years Amy Finnerty, formerly of MTV's programming department, claimed the video ""changed the entire look of MTV"" by giving the channel ""a whole new generation to sell to"". In 2000 the Guinness World Records named ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" the ""Most Played Video"" on MTV Europe. 
""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. In 2001, The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) ranked the song at number 80 on their Songs of the Century list. In 2002, NME ranked the song the number two on its list of ""100 Greatest Singles of All Time"", while Kerrang! ranked it at number one on its list of the ""100 Greatest Singles of All Time"". In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" ninth on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

The Cowboys defeated the Bills by the score of 52–17, winning their third Super Bowl in team history, and their first one in 15 years. This game is tied with Super Bowl XXXVII as the third-highest scoring Super Bowl with 69 combined points. The Bills became the first team to lose three consecutive Super Bowls, and just the second team to play in three straight (the Miami Dolphins played in Super Bowls VI–VIII, winning VII and VIII). The game was played on January 31, 1993 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, the seventh Super Bowl held in the Greater Los Angeles Area.
The Bills advanced to their third consecutive Super Bowl after posting an 11–5 regular season record, but entered the playoffs as a wild card after losing tiebreakers. The Cowboys were making their sixth Super Bowl appearance after posting a 13–3 regular season record. It was the first time that the two franchises had played each other since 1984.
The Cowboys scored 35 points off of a Super Bowl-record nine Buffalo turnovers, including three first half touchdowns. Bills backup quarterback Frank Reich, who replaced injured starter Jim Kelly in the second quarter, threw a 40-yard touchdown on the final play of the third quarter to cut the lead to 31–17. Dallas then scored three more touchdowns in the fourth quarter. Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman was named Super Bowl MVP, completing 22 of 30 passes for 273 yards and four touchdowns for a passer rating of 140.6, while also rushing for 28 yards.
In response to the Fox Network's Super Bowl counterprogramming of a special episode of In Living Color during the previous year, the NFL booked Michael Jackson to perform during the entire Super Bowl XXVII halftime show. Jackson's performance started the league's trend of signing top acts to appear during the Super Bowl to attract more viewers and interest.","{2052, 2568, 1576, 4140, 2092, 4671, 2112, 2141, 2149, 3174, 1646, 1136, 640, 3713, 1678, 3727, 4768, 2210, 3243, 173, 1711, 3777, 1739, 3795, 4307, 3812, 748, 1272, 3322, 3842, 1795, 3862, 4890, 4895, 1319, 4905, 4400, 826, 2875, 3909, 4430, 4944, 3413, 1888, 1890, 4971, 1388, 1908, 889, 1403, 892, 4990, 4993, 387, 903, 3978, 3979, 1938, 3989, 1432, 5022, 5033, 2483, 1979, 5052, 3520, 5059, 3524, 1990, 968, 971, 4051, 5077, 4056, 4568, 1502, 2018, 5097, 2039}",79,"['NFL', 'Phoenix', '1993', 'Super Bowl', 'Arizona', 'Martin Luther King', 'Super Bowl XXVII', 'American', 'the American Football Conference', 'AFC', 'Buffalo Bills', 'the National Football Conference', 'Dallas', 'the National Football League', 'NFL', 'the 1992 season', 'Cowboys', 'Super Bowl', '15 years', 'Super Bowl XXXVII', 'Super Bowl', 'Super Bowls', 'Miami', 'Super Bowls VI', 'VIII', 'VII', 'VIII', 'January 31, 1993', 'the Rose Bowl', 'Pasadena', 'California', 'Super Bowl', 'Los Angeles Area', 'Super Bowl', 'Super Bowl', '1984', 'Cowboys', 'Super Bowl-record', 'Buffalo', 'Frank Reich', 'Jim Kelly', 'the second quarter', 'the third quarter', '31–17', 'Dallas', 'the fourth quarter', 'Troy Aikman', 'Super Bowl MVP', ""the Fox Network's"", 'Super Bowl', 'Living Color', 'the previous year', 'NFL', 'Michael Jackson', 'Super Bowl', 'Jackson', 'the Super Bowl']","['ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'EVENT']"

The prime minister directs both the executive and the legislature, and together with their Cabinet is accountable to the monarch, to Parliament, to their party, and ultimately to the electorate, for the government's policies and actions.
The office of Prime Minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document but exists only by long-established convention, whereby the reigning monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber. The position of Prime Minister was not created; it evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history. The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective. The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement (1688–1720) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament. Although the sovereign was not stripped of the ancient prerogative powers and legally remained the head of government, politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a prime minister who could command a majority in Parliament.
By the 1830s, the Westminster system of government (or cabinet government) had emerged; the prime minister had become primus inter pares or the first among equals in the Cabinet and the head of government in the United Kingdom. The political position of Prime Minister was enhanced by the development of modern political parties, the introduction of mass communication and photography. By the start of the 20th century the modern premiership had emerged; the office had become the pre-eminent position in the constitutional hierarchy vis-à-vis the Sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet.
Prior to 1902, the prime minister sometimes came from the House of Lords, provided that his government could form a majority in the Commons. However as the power of the aristocracy waned during the 19th century the convention developed that the prime minister should always sit as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the lower house, making them answerable only to the Commons in Parliament. As leader of the House of Commons, the prime minister's authority was further enhanced by the Parliament Act 1911 which marginalised the influence of the House of Lords in the law-making process.
The prime minister is ex officio also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service. Indeed, certain privileges, such as residency of 10 Downing Street, are accorded to prime ministers by virtue of their position as First Lord of the Treasury.
The status and executive powers of the British prime minister means that the incumbent is consistently ranked as one of the most powerful and influential people in the world.

They are currently a trio composed of baritone Nathan Morris alongside tenors Wanya Morris and Shawn Stockman. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men found fame on Motown Records as a quartet including bass Michael McCary, who left the group in 2003 due to multiple sclerosis .During the 1990s, Boyz II Men gained international success. This began with the release of top 5 singles ""Motownphilly"" and 
""It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday"" in 1991, followed by the number one single ""End of the Road"" in 1992, which reached the top of charts worldwide. ""End of the Road"" set a new record for longevity, staying at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for thirteen weeks. Boyz II Men proceeded to break this record with the subsequent releases of ""I'll Make Love to You"" and ""One Sweet Day"" (with Mariah Carey), which, at fourteen and sixteen weeks respectively, each set new records for the total number of weeks at number one. ""I'll Make Love to You"" also topped the charts in Australia (for four weeks) and garnered international success. 
Consequently, Boyz II Men is among the music industry's elite with regard to time spent at number one in Billboard history with 50 cumulative weeks, ranking fourth behind Presley, The Beatles, and Carey. Furthermore, when ""On Bended Knee"" took the number one spot away from ""I'll Make Love to You"", Boyz II Men became only the third artists ever (after The Beatles and Presley) to replace themselves at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. These achievements were enough to earn Boyz II Men recognition as Billboard magazine's biggest boy band during the period of 1987 to 2012.Boyz II Men continue to perform worldwide, as a trio. Their most recent studio album, Under The Streetlight, was released in 2017.

It reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart twice. It first reached number one in June 1974, and then in October 1982, with her re-recording on the soundtrack of the movie version of The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.  Thus, she achieved a number one position twice with the same song, a rare feat that Chubby Checker had done previously with ""The Twist"" becoming number one in 1960 and again in 1962.
Whitney Houston recorded her version of the song for the 1992 film The Bodyguard. Her single spent 14 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and is one of the best-selling singles of all time. It also holds the record for being the best-selling single by a woman in music history. Houston's version of ""I Will Always Love You"" re-entered the charts in 2012 after her death, making it the second single ever to reach the top three on the Billboard Hot 100 in separate chart runs.

As with traditional fantasy sports games, players compete against others by building a team of professional athletes from a particular league or competition while remaining under a salary cap, and earn points based on the actual statistical performance of the players in real-world competitions. Daily fantasy sports are an accelerated variant of traditional fantasy sports that are conducted over short-term periods, such as a week or single day of competition, as opposed to those that are played across an entire season. Daily fantasy sports are typically structured in the form of paid competitions typically referred to as a ""contest""; winners receive a share of a pre-determined pot funded by their entry fees. A portion of entry fee payments go to the provider as rake revenue.In the United States, the daily fantasy sports industry is dominated by two competing services: the New York-based FanDuel, and the Boston-based DraftKings. Both companies were established as venture capital-backed startup companies, received funding from investment firms, sports broadcasters, leagues, and team owners, and became known for the aggressive marketing of their services. As of September 2015, both companies have an estimated value of at least $1 billion, and control 95% of the  U.S. DFS market. The two primarily compete against smaller DFS services, such as DRAFT, Fantasy Aces, and Yahoo! Sports. The popularity of the daily fantasy format has been credited to its convenience in comparison to season-length games, as well as the focus on major cash prizes in the promotion of these services. Daily fantasy has also been credited with helping to improve television viewership and engagement with sports.
Daily fantasy sports have faced notable legal challenges, including disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians and other critics have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing the performance of their selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.
In the United States, the legality of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local gambling laws and other rulings. The federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIEGA) contains language dictating that fantasy sports are not considered an unlawful wager under the act; however, the act only prohibits the electronic transfer of funds from unlawful gambling as defined under state laws. A number of state attorneys general issued opinions concluding that DFS is a form of gambling, while the state of Nevada declared that DFS games must be licensed as a sports pool. The New York State lawsuit, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used inside information to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. By December 2017, 18 states, including Massachusetts and Virginia, had ruled that DFS was a legal game of skill.","{2, 3587, 7, 3091, 4115, 2079, 1058, 4642, 551, 4649, 1584, 2104, 576, 4675, 580, 1622, 2647, 4694, 4185, 3676, 1636, 2152, 1649, 1139, 3702, 127, 640, 3727, 3234, 1192, 4785, 703, 4287, 2241, 3777, 4829, 1251, 3322, 1276, 3842, 771, 1795, 3332, 1288, 1307, 4895, 805, 3371, 3887, 4923, 3908, 843, 1867, 2388, 2901, 3927, 355, 3427, 889, 890, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 3459, 3461, 903, 2955, 3979, 2964, 3482, 3999, 3495, 3500, 948, 2487, 1464, 4536, 452, 964, 1997, 5077, 2519, 4057, 5092, 3046, 2026, 5104, 3578, 4605}",90,"['NHL', '10 day', 'Daily', 'Daily', 'week', 'an entire season', 'Daily', 'the United States', 'New York', 'FanDuel', 'Boston', 'DraftKings', 'September 2015', '95%', 'U.S.', 'DFS', 'DRAFT', 'Fantasy Aces', 'Yahoo', 'Daily', 'Daily', 'DFS', 'week', 'DFS', 'the United States', 'DFS', 'DFS', 'Nevada', 'DFS', 'New York State', 'DFS', 'DraftKings', 'FanDuel', 'December 2017', 'Massachusetts', 'Virginia', 'DFS']","['ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON']"

Adjacent to the National Mall in Washington, D.C., the USHMM provides for the documentation, study, and interpretation of Holocaust history. It is dedicated to helping leaders and citizens of the world confront hatred, prevent genocide, promote human dignity, and strengthen democracy.The museum has an operating budget, as of September 2018, of $120.6 million. In 2008, the museum had a staff of about 400 employees, 125 contractors, 650 volunteers, 91 Holocaust survivors, and 175,000 members. It had local offices in New York City, Boston, Boca Raton, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas.Since its dedication on April 22, 1993, the Museum has had nearly 40 million visitors, including more than 10 million school children, 99 heads of state, and more than 3,500 foreign officials from over 211 countries. The Museum's visitors came from all over the world, and less than 10 percent of the Museum's visitors are Jewish. Its website had 25 million visits in 2008 from an average of 100 different countries daily. Thirty-five percent of these visits were from outside the United States.The USHMM's collections contain more than 12,750 artifacts, 49 million pages of archival documents, 85,000 historical photographs, a list of over 200,000 registered survivors and their families, 1,000 hours of archival footage, 93,000 library items, and 9,000 oral history testimonies. It also has teacher fellows in every state in the United States and almost 400 university fellows from 26 countries since 1994.Researchers at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum have documented 42,500 ghettos and concentration camps erected by the Nazis throughout German-controlled areas of Europe from 1933 to 1945.","{1539, 7, 524, 528, 2066, 3091, 1566, 4642, 4134, 3632, 2104, 2122, 4682, 3151, 4688, 595, 1622, 4192, 97, 3174, 3686, 1640, 2152, 1649, 3702, 2169, 2171, 127, 128, 640, 4736, 1668, 4235, 2702, 2703, 3727, 4768, 2210, 1709, 174, 4785, 694, 3777, 1739, 1235, 3795, 4307, 4824, 4829, 1780, 1272, 3322, 3842, 1795, 3332, 1802, 3348, 283, 4895, 290, 3874, 3365, 4905, 3371, 4407, 2875, 4413, 4426, 1357, 3927, 3427, 874, 4971, 4983, 889, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 903, 2955, 3979, 403, 2964, 3989, 3500, 434, 948, 949, 4020, 1464, 1979, 4539, 3520, 1985, 5059, 452, 964, 4549, 967, 968, 971, 2507, 1997, 4561, 467, 2004, 5077, 2525, 1502, 5088, 2529, 996, 3578, 4605}",115,"['Holocaust Memorial Museum', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'The United States', 'USHMM', ""the United States'"", 'Holocaust', 'the National Mall', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'USHMM', 'Holocaust', 'September 2018', '2008', 'Holocaust', 'New York City', 'Boston', 'Boca Raton', 'Chicago', 'Los Angeles', 'Dallas', 'April 22, 1993', 'Museum', 'Museum', 'less than 10 percent', 'Museum', 'Jewish', '2008', 'daily', 'Thirty-five percent', 'the United States', 'USHMM', 'the United States', 'the United States', 'Nazis', 'German', 'Europe', '1933 to 1945']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERCENT', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'DATE']"

The cases n = 1 and n = 2 have been known since antiquity to have an infinite number of solutions.The proposition was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica; Fermat added that he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. However, there were doubts that he had a correct proof because his claim was published by his son without his consent and after his death.  After 358 years of effort by mathematicians, the first successful proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995; it was described as a ""stunning advance"" in the citation for Wiles's Abel Prize award in 2016. It also proved much of the modularity theorem and opened up entire new approaches to numerous other problems and mathematically powerful modularity lifting techniques.
The unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century. It is among the most notable theorems in the history of mathematics and prior to its proof was in the Guinness Book of World Records as the ""most difficult mathematical problem"" in part because the theorem has the largest number of unsuccessful proofs.","{4224, 3842, 2051, 387, 7, 3979, 1678, 3862, 1177, 3365, 4134, 1709, 4526, 4785, 2483, 4661, 2682, 4024, 703, 2112, 580, 3524, 1739, 2507, 2891, 4430, 595, 2388, 4051, 4307, 3803, 2141, 4829, 607, 1888, 889, 1890, 3812, 3813, 873, 4971, 1388, 4589, 1646, 1136, 4722, 2039, 2169, 3322, 3451, 892, 127}",52,"['English', 'Andrew Wiles', 'Fermat', 'Fermat', 'Pierre de Fermat', '1637', 'Fermat', '358 years', '1994', 'Andrew Wiles', '1995', 'Wiles', 'Abel Prize', '2016', 'the 19th century', 'the 20th century', 'the Guinness Book of World Records']","['LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART']"

It was the first face-to-face agreement between the government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
Negotiations concerning the agreement, an outgrowth of the Madrid Conference of 1991, were conducted secretly in Oslo, Norway, hosted by the Fafo institute, and completed on 20 August 1993; the Oslo Accords were subsequently officially signed at a public ceremony in Washington, D.C., on 13 September 1993, in the presence of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and U.S. President Bill Clinton. The documents themselves were signed by Mahmoud Abbas for the PLO, foreign Minister Shimon Peres for Israel, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher for the United States and foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev for Russia.
The Accord provided for the creation of a Palestinian interim self-government, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). The Palestinian Authority would have responsibility for the administration of the territory under its control. The Accords also called for the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
It was anticipated that this arrangement would last for a five-year interim period during which a permanent agreement would be negotiated (beginning no later than May 1996). Remaining issues such as Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Israeli settlements, security and borders would be part of the ""permanent status negotiations"" during this period.
In August 1993, the delegations had reached an agreement, which was signed in secrecy by Peres while visiting Oslo. In the Letters of Mutual Recognition, the PLO acknowledged the State of Israel and pledged to reject violence, and Israel recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people and as partner in negotiations. Yasser Arafat was allowed to return to the Occupied Palestinian Territories. In 1995, the Oslo I Accord was followed by Oslo II. Neither promised Palestinian statehood.","{4097, 3842, 515, 4994, 903, 4871, 1929, 2955, 3979, 4235, 3727, 144, 528, 666, 1566, 4895, 4768, 159, 1058, 4905, 3243, 2171, 1709, 4526, 1584, 4785, 4661, 2104, 1979, 4413, 703, 3777, 452, 580, 964, 3524, 1997, 4561, 3578, 1491, 2004, 3413, 3795, 4307, 5077, 4829, 996, 2152, 4330, 4971, 3702, 4472, 889, 3322, 2555, 4605, 890}",57,"['Oslo Peace Accords', 'Norway', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'the following month', 'The Oslo I Accord or', 'the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements', 'Declaration of Principles', '1993', 'Israeli', 'Palestinian', 'Israel', 'the Palestine Liberation Organization', 'PLO', 'the Madrid Conference', '1991', 'Oslo', 'Norway', 'the Fafo institute', '20 August 1993', 'the Oslo Accords', 'Washington', 'D.C.', '13 September 1993', 'PLO', 'Yasser Arafat', 'Israeli', 'Yitzhak Rabin', 'U.S.', 'Bill Clinton', 'Mahmoud Abbas', 'PLO', 'Shimon Peres', 'Israel', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Warren Christopher', 'the United States', 'Andrei Kozyrev', 'Russia', 'Accord', 'Palestinian', 'the Palestinian National Authority', 'The Palestinian Authority', 'Accords', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'the Gaza Strip', 'West Bank', 'five-year', 'May 1996', 'Jerusalem', 'Palestinian', 'Israeli', 'August 1993', 'Peres', 'Oslo', 'PLO', 'the State of Israel', 'Israel', 'PLO', 'Palestinian', 'Yasser Arafat', 'the Occupied Palestinian Territories', '1995', 'the Oslo I Accord', 'Oslo II', 'Palestinian']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PRODUCT', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'PERSON', 'NORP']"

650,1993,October,15,Nelson Mandela and South African President F. W. de Klerk awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._de_Klerk,"Frederik Willem de Klerk  (, Afrikaans: [ˈfrɪədərək ˈvələm də ˈklɛrk]; born 18 March 1936) is a South African politician who served as State President of South Africa from 1989 to 1994 and as Deputy President from 1994 to 1996. As South Africa's last head of state from the era of white-minority rule, he and his government dismantled the apartheid system and introduced universal suffrage. Ideologically a conservative and an economic liberal, he led the National Party from 1989 to 1997.
Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to an influential Afrikaner family, de Klerk studied at Potchefstroom University before pursuing a career in law. Joining the National Party, to which he had family ties, he was elected to parliament and sat in the white-minority government of P. W. Botha, holding a succession of ministerial posts. As a minister, he supported and enforced apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged white South Africans. After Botha resigned in 1989, de Klerk replaced him, first as leader of the National Party and then as State President. Although observers expected him to continue Botha's defence of apartheid, de Klerk decided to end the policy. He was aware that growing ethnic animosity and violence was leading South Africa into a racial civil war. Amid this violence, the state security forces committed widespread human rights abuses and encouraged violence between Xhosa and Zulu, although de Klerk later denied sanctioning such actions. He permitted anti-apartheid marches to take place, legalised a range of previously banned anti-apartheid political parties, and freed imprisoned anti-apartheid activists, including Nelson Mandela. He also dismantled South Africa's nuclear weapons program.
De Klerk negotiated with Mandela to fully dismantle apartheid and establish a transition to universal suffrage. In 1993, he publicly apologised for apartheid's harmful effects, although not for apartheid itself. He oversaw the 1994 non-racial election in which Mandela led the African National Congress (ANC) to victory; de Klerk's National Party took second place with 20% of the vote. After the election, de Klerk became a Deputy President in Mandela's ANC-led coalition, the Government of National Unity. In this position, he supported the government's liberal economic policies. De Klerk had desired a total amnesty for political crimes committed under apartheid and opposed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate past human rights abuses by both pro and anti-apartheid groups. His working relationship with Mandela was strained, although he later spoke fondly of him. In May 1996, after the National Party objected to the new constitution, de Klerk withdrew it from the coalition government; the party disbanded the following year and reformed as the New National Party. In 1997, he retired from active politics and since then has lectured internationally.
De Klerk is a controversial figure. The recipient of a wide range of awards—including the Nobel Peace Prize—he was widely praised for dismantling apartheid and bringing universal suffrage to South Africa. Conversely, anti-apartheid activists criticised him for offering only a qualified apology for apartheid and for ignoring the human rights abuses carried out by his state security forces, while South Africa's white right-wing claimed that by abandoning apartheid he had betrayed the interests of the country's white minority.",set(),0,"['Nelson Mandela', 'South African', 'F.

654,1993,June,8,"Drag queen RuPaul releases his debut album ""Supermodel of the World""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermodel_(You_Better_Work),"""Supermodel (You Better Work)"" is a 1992 song by the dance music singer and drag queen RuPaul. It was the third single (but first major label single) from his album Supermodel of the World. The song was a dance club anthem that, though particularly popular with gay audiences, found mainstream success. The song consists of RuPaul giving advice to a young black supermodel, and briefly several other models, largely consisting of ""sashay, shantay!"", ""work, turn to the left"", ""work, now turn to the right"", and ""you better work"". The music video for the song, featuring RuPaul in various outfits cavorting around town, became a staple on MTV. Singer Kurt Cobain of Nirvana cited the song as one of his favorites of 1993, and the two were photographed together at the MTV Video Music Awards that year.
""Supermodel"" was a modest hit on the pop charts in both the US (number 45) and the UK (number 39). It also reached number two on the US dance chart. This song is RuPaul's highest charting pop hit in the US to date. The song features spoken word snippets by actress LaWanda Page, who went on to appear in several music videos by RuPaul. The single is most commonly found on compact disc coupled with ""House of Love"", which would go on to become a single itself in some markets. Various 12-inch vinyl releases were also pressed, including a limited edition picture disc in the United Kingdom. It was also covered by Taylor Dayne from The Lizzie McGuire Movie soundtrack. In 2017, BuzzFeed listed the song at number 42 in their list of ""The 101 Greatest Dance Songs Of the '90s"".","{4101, 2568, 521, 523, 528, 4113, 3090, 3091, 1562, 2589, 2078, 4643, 1573, 4134, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4647, 1583, 2096, 2104, 1081, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4688, 1622, 2647, 2649, 3163, 1633, 3686, 2152, 619, 2155, 3693, 1136, 625, 1649, 2169, 2170, 3195, 2682, 2171, 3199, 640, 1153, 2176, 131, 4605, 1162, 4235, 2702, 2703, 144, 3727, 4758, 4768, 2213, 1192, 4785, 2740, 202, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 3285, 4313, 3804, 3805, 4829, 3808, 1251, 3813, 3303, 2793, 2794, 4330, 2798, 1783, 1275, 4859, 1288, 1292, 4879, 1808, 3869, 4895, 290, 294, 807, 4905, 4916, 310, 311, 4407, 4920, 2875, 4413, 3903, 4426, 2891, 4940, 4941, 4942, 2388, 2901, 4445, 1888, 1386, 4971, 1388, 2415, 3954, 4472, 4474, 3451, 4990, 4993, 3970, 4994, 3460, 4998, 3978, 2955, 3979, 2964, 3989, 1432, 418, 4014, 4024, 1979, 4539, 5059, 452, 4549, 967, 5065, 971, 2507, 1997, 2508, 5067, 5077, 5079, 3034, 2012, 1502, 3040, 1508, 2026, 492, 4589, 5106, 5107, 1526, 2040, 5117}",163,"['Drag queen RuPaul', 'Supermodel of the World', 'Supermodel (You Better Work', '1992', 'RuPaul', 'RuPaul', 'RuPaul', 'MTV', 'Kurt Cobain', 'Nirvana', '1993', 'the MTV Video Music Awards', 'Supermodel', 'US', 'UK', 'US', 'RuPaul', 'US', 'LaWanda Page', 'RuPaul', '""House of Love""', 'the United Kingdom', 'Taylor Dayne', 'The Lizzie McGuire Movie', '2017', 'BuzzFeed', ""The 101 Greatest Dance Songs Of the '90s""]","['PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART']"

It began in 1990 when Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment bought the rights to the novel by Michael Crichton before it was even published. The book was successful, as was Steven Spielberg's 1993 film adaptation. The film received a theatrical 3D re-release in 2013, and was selected in 2018 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""
A sequel novel, The Lost World, was published in 1995, followed by a film adaptation in 1997. Subsequent films in the series, including Jurassic Park III (2001), are not based on the novels. Numerous video games and comic books based on the franchise have been created since the release of the 1993 film, and several water rides have been opened at various Universal theme parks. As of 2000, the franchise had generated $5 billion in revenue, making it one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.The fourth film, Jurassic World, was initially scheduled to be released in 2005, but was delayed numerous times and was ultimately released in June 2015. It became the first film to gross over $500 million worldwide in its opening weekend, and grossed over $1.6 billion through the course of its theatrical run, making it the third highest-grossing film at the time. It was also the second highest-grossing film of 2015. When adjusted for monetary inflation, Jurassic World is the second highest-grossing film in the franchise after Jurassic Park. Since the film's release, the franchise has continued to use the Jurassic World name.
A fifth film, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, was released in June 2018. The film grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide, making it the third Jurassic film to pass the billion dollar mark. It is the third highest-grossing film of 2018 and the 13th highest-grossing film of all time. A sixth film, titled Jurassic World: Dominion, is scheduled to be released on June 11, 2021. Lego has produced several animated projects based on the Jurassic World films, including a miniseries released in 2019. Netflix and DreamWorks Animation also plan to release an animated series, Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous, in 2020.","{1025, 3970, 4611, 1795, 1800, 2568, 3978, 4879, 273, 1938, 4990, 1432, 2210, 4134, 1319, 1575, 1576, 4007, 5033, 2171, 1711, 4400, 1847, 4024, 826, 1979, 3520, 3908, 1990, 2507, 2508, 4940, 1233, 3154, 595, 467, 4307, 4561, 2391, 4694, 4825, 5080, 1502, 889, 2018, 5092, 874, 748, 1133, 3190, 2169, 3322, 3451, 4605, 890}",55,"['Jurassic Park', 'Steven Spielberg', 'Sam Neill', 'Jeff Goldblum', 'weekend', 'Jurassic Park', 'Jurassic World', 'American', '1990', 'Universal Pictures', 'Amblin Entertainment', 'Michael Crichton', ""Steven Spielberg's"", '1993', '2013', '2018', 'the United States National Film Registry', 'Congress', 'The Lost World', '1995', '1997', 'Jurassic Park III', '2001', '1993', 'Universal', '2000', 'Jurassic World', '2005', 'June 2015', '2015', 'Jurassic World', 'Jurassic Park', 'Jurassic World', 'Fallen Kingdom', 'June 2018', 'Jurassic', '2018', 'Jurassic World: Dominion', 'June 11, 2021', 'Lego', 'the Jurassic World', '2019', 'DreamWorks Animation', 'Jurassic World', '2020']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"

He topped the Test batting rankings on several occasions and holds several cricketing records, including the record for the highest individual score in first-class cricket, with 501 not out for Warwickshire against Durham at Edgbaston in 1994, which is the only quintuple-hundred in first-class cricket history.
Lara also holds the record for the highest individual score in a Test innings after scoring 400 not out against England at Antigua in 2004. Lara also shares the test record of scoring the highest number of runs in a single over in a Test match, when he scored 28 runs off an over by Robin Peterson of South Africa in 2003 (matched in 2013 by Australia's George Bailey).Lara's match-winning performance of 153 not out against Australia in Bridgetown, Barbados in 1999 has been rated by Wisden as the second-best batting performance in the history of Test cricket, next only to the 270 runs scored by Sir Donald Bradman in The Ashes Test match of 1937. Muttiah Muralitharan, rated as the greatest Test match bowler ever by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and the highest wicket-taker in both Test cricket and in One Day Internationals (ODIs), has hailed Lara as his toughest opponent among all batsmen in the world. Lara was awarded the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World awards in 1994 and 1995 and is also one of only three cricketers to receive the prestigious BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year, the other two being Sir Garfield Sobers and Shane Warne.Brian Lara was appointed honorary member of the Order of Australia on 27 November 2009. On 14 September 2012 he was inducted to the ICC's Hall of Fame at the awards ceremony held in Colombo, Sri Lanka as a 2012–13 season inductee along with Australians Glenn McGrath and former England women all-rounder Enid Bakewell. In 2013, Lara received Honorary Life Membership of the MCC becoming the 31st West Indian to receive the honor.Brian Lara is popularly nicknamed as ""The Prince of Port of Spain"" or simply ""The Prince"".

He was previously the head coach of the Baltimore Colts, with whom he won the 1968 NFL Championship. Shula was drafted out of John Carroll University in the 1951 NFL Draft, and he played professionally as a defensive back for the Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Colts, and Washington Redskins.
Shula was named 1993 Sportsman of the Year by Sports Illustrated. He had only two losing seasons in his 33-year career as a head coach in the NFL. He led his teams to six Super Bowls. In Super Bowl III, his first, the Colts set the record for the longest period to be shut out, not scoring until 3:19 remained in the game, which was later broken in Super Bowl VII. At his next Super Bowl, the Dolphins set the Super Bowl record for the lowest points scored by any team, with one field goal. The following year, he coached a perfect season and broke the record of longest shutout, this time with his team on the winning side, not giving up any points until 2:07 remained. The Dolphins repeated as Super Bowl champions the following season, as they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24–7.

His second novel, Midnight's Children (1981), won the Booker Prize in 1981 and was deemed to be ""the best novel of all winners"" on two separate occasions, marking the 25th and the 40th anniversary of the prize. Much of his fiction is set on the Indian subcontinent. He combines magical realism with historical fiction; his work is concerned with the many connections, disruptions, and migrations between Eastern and Western civilizations.
His fourth novel, The Satanic Verses (1988), was the subject of a major controversy, provoking protests from Muslims in several countries. Death threats were made against him, including a fatwā calling for his assassination issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran, on 14 February 1989. The British government put Rushdie under police protection.
In 1983, Rushdie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, the UK's senior literary organisation. He was appointed Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres of France in January 1999. In June 2007, Queen Elizabeth II knighted him for his services to literature. In 2008, The Times ranked him thirteenth on its list of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945.Since 2000, Rushdie has lived in the United States.

Mayor Marion Barry divorces his wife Effi",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Barry,"Marion Shepilov Barry (born Marion Barry Jr.; March 6, 1936 – November 23, 2014) was an American politician who served as the second mayor of the District of Columbia from 1979 to 1991, and again as the fourth mayor from 1995 to 1999. A Democrat, Barry had served three tenures on the Council of the District of Columbia, representing as an at-large member from 1975 to 1979 and in Ward 8 from 1993 to 1995, and again from 2005 to 2014. In the 1960s he was involved in the civil rights movement, first as a member of the Nashville Student Movement and then serving as the first chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).
Barry came to national prominence as mayor of the national capital, the first prominent civil rights activist to become chief executive of a major American city. He gave the presidential nomination speech for Jesse Jackson at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. His celebrity was transformed into international notoriety in January 1990, when he was videotaped during a sting operation smoking crack cocaine and was arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials on drug charges. The arrest and subsequent trial precluded Barry from seeking re-election, and he served six months in a federal prison. After his release, he was elected to the Council of the District of Columbia in 1992. He was elected again as mayor in 1994, serving from 1995 to 1999.
Despite his history of political and legal controversies, Barry was a popular and influential figure in Washington, D.C. The alternative weekly Washington City Paper nicknamed him ""Mayor for life"", a designation that remained long after Barry left the mayoralty.

He also won three year-end championships and 16 Grand Prix Super Series titles. Overall, he set numerous records that still stand. Borg was the first player to win six French Open singles titles.

As a result, the professional tour became more lucrative, and in 1979 he was the first player to earn more than one million dollars in prize money in a single season.

668,1994,March,12,Church of England ordains 1st 33 women priests,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_(United_States),"The Episcopal Church (TEC) is a member church of the worldwide Anglican Communion and is based in the United States with additional dioceses elsewhere. It is a mainline Christian denomination divided into nine provinces. The presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church is Michael Bruce Curry, the first African-American bishop to serve in that position.
In 2018, the Episcopal Church had 1,835,931 baptized members, of whom 1,676,349 were in the United States. In 2011, it was the nation's 14th largest denomination. In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 1.2 percent of the adult population in the United States, or 3 million people, self-identify as mainline Episcopalians.The church was organized after the American Revolution, when it became separate from the Church of England, whose clergy are required to swear allegiance to the British monarch as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The Episcopal Church describes itself as ""Protestant, yet Catholic"". The Episcopal Church claims apostolic succession, tracing its bishops back to the apostles via holy orders. The Book of Common Prayer, a collection of traditional rites, blessings, liturgies, and prayers used throughout the Anglican Communion, is central to Episcopal worship.
The Episcopal Church was active in the Social Gospel movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1960s and 1970s, the church has pursued a decidedly more liberal course. It has opposed the death penalty and supported the civil rights movement and affirmative action. Some of its leaders and priests are known for marching with influential civil rights demonstrators such as Martin Luther King Jr. The church calls for the full legal equality of LGBT people. In 2015, the church's 78th triennial General Convention passed resolutions allowing the blessing of same-sex marriages and approved two official liturgies to bless such unions.The Episcopal Church ordains women and LGBT people to the priesthood, the diaconate, and the episcopate, despite opposition from a number of other member churches of the Anglican Communion.

Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war, and the Rwandan government led by President Juvénal Habyarimana signed the Arusha Accords with the RPF on 4 August 1993. Most historians agree that a genocide against the Tutsi had been planned for at least a year. However, Habyarimana's assassination on 6 April 1994 created a power vacuum and ended peace accords. Genocidal killings began the following day when soldiers, police, and militia executed key Tutsi and moderate Hutu military and political leaders.
The scale and brutality of the massacre caused shock worldwide, but no country intervened to forcefully stop the killings. Most of the victims were killed in their own villages or towns, many by their neighbors and fellow villagers. Hutu gangs searched out victims hiding in churches and school buildings. The militia murdered victims with machetes and rifles. An estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 Rwandans were killed, about 70% of the country's Tutsi population. Sexual violence was rife, with an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 women raped during the genocide. The RPF quickly resumed the civil war once the genocide started and captured all government territory, ending the genocide and forcing the government and genocidaires into Zaire.
The genocide had lasting and profound effects on Rwanda and neighbouring countries. In 1996, the RPF-led Rwandan government launched an offensive into Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), home to exiled leaders of the former Rwandan government and many Hutu refugees, starting the First Congo War. Today, Rwanda has two public holidays to mourn the genocide, and denial or historical revisionism of the genocide is a criminal offence.","{3861, 1157, 2255}",3,"['Hutus', 'Kibuye', 'Rwanda', 'Rwandan', 'Tutsi', 'Tutsi', 'Twa', 'Hutu', 'Rwanda', 'between 7 April and 15 July 1994', 'the Rwandan Civil War', '1990', 'the Rwandan Patriotic Front', 'RPF', 'Rwanda', 'Uganda', 'the Rwandan Civil War', 'Rwandan', 'Juvénal Habyarimana', 'the Arusha Accords', 'RPF', '4 August 1993', 'Tutsi', 'at least a year', 'Habyarimana', '6 April 1994', 'the following day', 'Rwandans', 'about 70%', 'RPF', 'Zaire', 'Rwanda', '1996', 'RPF', 'Rwandan', 'Zaire', 'the Democratic Republic of the', 'Rwandan', 'Hutu', 'the First Congo War', 'Today', 'Rwanda']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'LAW', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERCENT', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE']"

The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy rescued refugees from the sea and other migrants attempted to cross the landmine field that then separated the U.S. and Cuban military areas. Soldiers, Airmen, and Marines provided refugee camp security at Guantanamo Bay, and ship security on board the Coast Guard cutters.

674,1994,August,31,The Provisional Irish Republican Army (Sinn Féin) declares a ceasefire in Northern Ireland,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army_campaign,"From 1969 until 1997, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) conducted an armed paramilitary campaign primarily in Northern Ireland and England, aimed at ending British rule in Northern Ireland in order to create a united Ireland.The Provisional IRA emerged from a split in the Irish Republican Army in 1969, partly as a result of that organisation's perceived failure to defend Catholic neighbourhoods from attack in the 1969 Northern Ireland riots. The Provisionals gained credibility from their efforts to physically defend such areas in 1970 and 1971. From 1971–72, the IRA took to the offensive and conducted a relatively high intensity campaign against the British and Northern Ireland security forces and the infrastructure of the state. The British Army characterised this period as the 'insurgency phase' of the IRA's campaign.
The IRA declared a brief ceasefire in 1972 and a more protracted one in 1975, when there was an internal debate over the feasibility of future operations. The armed group reorganised itself in the late 1970s into a smaller, cell-based structure, which was designed to be harder to penetrate. The IRA now tried to carry out a smaller scale but more sustained campaign which they characterised as the 'Long War', with the eventual aim of weakening the British government's resolve to remain in Ireland. The British Army called this the 'terrorist phase' of the IRA's campaign.
The IRA made some attempts in the 1980s to escalate the conflict with the aid of weapons imported from Libya. In the 1990s they also began a campaign of bombing economic targets in London and other cities in England.
On 31 August 1994, the IRA called a unilateral ceasefire with the aim of having their associated political party, Sinn Féin, admitted into the Northern Ireland peace process. The organisation ended its ceasefire in February 1996 but declared another in July 1997. The IRA accepted the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 as a negotiated end to the Northern Ireland conflict. In 2005 the organisation declared a formal end to its campaign and had its weaponry decommissioned under international supervision.
Other aspects of the Provisional IRA's campaign are covered in the following articles:

676,1994,May,12,"""Pulp Fiction"", directed by Quentin Tarantino and starring John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Samuel L. Jackson premieres at the Cannes Film Festival (Palme d'Or 1994)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction,"Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, who conceived it with Roger Avary. Starring John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, it tells several stories of criminal Los Angeles. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.
Tarantino wrote Pulp Fiction in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for True Romance (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of ""pulp"". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as ""too demented"". Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed.
Pulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival, and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Original Screenplay; it earned Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman Academy Award nominations and boosted their careers. Its development, marketing, distribution, and profitability had a sweeping effect on independent cinema.
Pulp Fiction is widely regarded as Tarantino's masterpiece, with particular praise for its screenwriting. The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing movies and other media that adopted elements of its style. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the best film since 1983 and it has appeared on many critics' lists of the greatest films ever made. In 2013, Pulp Fiction was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".","{1432, 290, 4134, 4007, 690, 1847, 4920, 826, 3520, 1990, 967, 2507, 4683, 4815, 1616, 5074, 595, 467, 4307, 4824, 4825, 1888, 2018, 997, 874, 3180, 4589, 1908, 1653, 2169, 4990, 895}",32,"['Pulp Fiction', 'Quentin Tarantino', 'John Travolta', 'Uma Thurman', 'Samuel L.

With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane.
Kauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the title Insomnia Cafe between November and December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including title changes to Six of One and Friends Like Us, the series was finally named Friends.Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. All ten seasons of Friends ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings; it ultimately reached the number-one spot in its eighth season. The series finale aired on May 6, 2004, and was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth most-watched series finale in television history, and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s.Friends received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television shows of all time. The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series award in 2002 for its eighth season. The show ranked no. 21 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, and no. 7 on Empire magazine's The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 1997, the episode ""The One with the Prom Video"" was ranked no. 100 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time.

678,1994,June,27,Aerosmith become first major band to let fans download a full new track free from the internet,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosmith,"Aerosmith is an American rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. The group consists of Steven Tyler (vocals, guitars, keyboards), Joe Perry (guitar), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums) and Brad Whitford (guitar). Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop rock, heavy metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. They are sometimes referred to as ""the Bad Boys from Boston"" and ""America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band""..  As a partnership, the primary songwriting team of Tyler and Perry is often collectively known as the ""Toxic Twins"".
Perry and Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with Tyler, Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston. They were signed to Columbia Records in 1972, and released a string of gold and platinum albums, beginning with their 1973 eponymous debut album, followed by Get Your Wings in 1974. In 1975, the band broke into the mainstream with the album Toys in the Attic, and their 1976 follow-up Rocks cemented their status as hard rock superstars. Draw the Line and Night in the Ruts followed in 1977 and 1979 respectively. Their first five albums have since attained multi-platinum status. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Billboard Hot 100 singles, including their first Top 40 hit ""Sweet Emotion"" and the Top 10 hits ""Dream On"" and ""Walk This Way"". By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a following of fans, often referred to as the ""Blue Army"". Drug addiction and internal conflict took their toll on the band, which led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively; they were replaced by Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay.
The band did not fare well between 1980 and 1984, releasing the album Rock in a Hard Place, which was certified gold but failed to match their previous successes.
Perry and Whitford returned to Aerosmith in 1984 and the band signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to match commercial expectations. It was not until the band's collaboration with rap group Run–D.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release, Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several Top 40 hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), while they embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. Their biggest hit singles (all of which reached the Top 20) during this time included ""Dude (Looks Like a Lady)"", ""Angel"", ""Rag Doll"", ""Love in an Elevator"", ""Janie's Got a Gun"", ""What it Takes"", ""Livin' on the Edge"", ""Cryin'"", and ""Crazy"". The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. In 1998, they achieved their first number-one hit with ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" from Armageddon's soundtrack and the following year, their own roller coaster attraction opened at Walt Disney World. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock history. Additional albums Just Push Play (which included the Top 10 hit ""Jaded""), Honkin' on Bobo (a collection of blues covers), and Music from Another Dimension! followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012 respectively, and in 2008, they released Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, which is considered to be the best-selling band-centric video game. After 50 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music, but is embarking on a farewell tour that will likely last several years. The band has an ongoing concert residency in Las Vegas that will last through mid 2020.
Aerosmith is the best-selling American hard rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 70 million records in the United States alone. With 25 gold albums, 18 platinum albums, and 12 multi-platinum albums, they hold the record for the most total certifications by an American band and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American band. The band has scored twenty-one Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and were included among both Rolling Stone's and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time at number 57 and number 30 respectively. In 2013, the band's principal songwriters, Tyler and Perry, were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 2020, the band received the MusiCares Person of the Year award.","{2051, 2052, 2565, 7, 2568, 3091, 3098, 1058, 1576, 2104, 2621, 4671, 2112, 1095, 586, 4682, 595, 1622, 2141, 608, 3686, 2152, 1136, 2682, 2171, 3199, 640, 4736, 3727, 1177, 4768, 2210, 677, 1704, 3243, 173, 174, 1709, 4785, 703, 717, 3795, 4307, 4824, 4825, 3803, 4829, 3298, 3812, 3813, 744, 4330, 748, 1272, 3322, 3842, 1795, 3862, 1311, 4895, 3874, 4905, 1834, 815, 4915, 310, 4920, 4426, 2379, 1357, 4430, 337, 2388, 3413, 4437, 3927, 4445, 1888, 1890, 3427, 4971, 876, 1388, 1905, 4472, 3449, 889, 3451, 892, 4990, 4993, 3970, 387, 900, 1924, 2435, 3459, 4994, 3978, 2955, 3979, 1938, 2964, 3989, 5019, 5033, 2475, 4020, 4539, 961, 452, 964, 1990, 967, 968, 3524, 2508, 1997, 4558, 4051, 2004, 5077, 2525, 4589, 2555, 4605}",126,"['American', 'Boston', 'Massachusetts', '1970', 'Steven Tyler', 'Joe Perry', 'Tom Hamilton', 'Joey Kramer', 'Brad Whitford', 'the Bad Boys', 'Boston', 'America', 'Tyler and Perry', 'the ""Toxic Twins""', 'Perry', 'Hamilton', 'the Jam Band', 'Tyler', 'Kramer', 'Ray Tabano', '1971', 'Tabano', 'Whitford', 'Boston', 'Columbia Records', '1972', '1973', 'Get Your Wings', '1974', '1975', 'Attic', '1976', 'Rocks', 'Draw the Line and Night in the', 'Ruts', '1977', '1979', 'the 1970s', 'Billboard Hot 100', 'Sweet Emotion', '""Dream', 'Walk This Way', 'the end of the decade', 'the ""Blue Army""', 'Perry', 'Whitford', '1979', '1981', 'Jimmy Crespo', 'Rick Dufay', 'between 1980 and 1984', 'Perry', 'Whitford', '1984', 'Geffen Records', '1985', 'Run', '1986', '1987', 'Permanent Vacation', 'the 1970s', 'the late 1980s and 1990s', '1989', '1993', 'Nine Lives', '1997', 'Dude', 'Angel', 'Rag Doll', 'Love in an Elevator', ""Janie's Got a Gun"", 'Livin', 'Cryin', 'Crazy', '1998', 'Armageddon', 'the following year', 'Walt Disney World', 'Jaded', 'Bobo', '2001', '2004', '2012', '2008', 'Guitar Hero:', '50 years', 'last several years', 'Las Vegas', 'mid 2020', 'American', 'the United States', 'American', 'American', 'Mainstream Rock', 'Grammy Awards', 'American Music Awards', 'the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame', '2001', ""Rolling Stone's"", 'VH1', '2013', 'Tyler and Perry', 'the Songwriters Hall of Fame', '2020']","['NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE']"
679,1994,August,23,"Jeff Buckley releases his album ""Grace"", featuring his cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Buckley,"Jeffrey Scott Buckley (November 17, 1966 – May 29, 1997), raised as Scott Moorhead, was an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles, Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by playing cover songs at venues in Manhattan's East Village such as Sin-é, gradually focusing more on his own material. After rebuffing much interest from record labels and Herb Cohen, the manager of his singer father, Tim Buckley, he signed with Columbia, recruited a band, and recorded what would be his only studio album, Grace, in 1994.
Over the following three years, the band toured extensively to promote the album, including concerts in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia. In 1996, they stopped touring and made sporadic attempts to record Buckley's second album in New York City with Tom Verlaine as producer.
In 1997, Buckley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to resume work on the album, to be titled My Sweetheart the Drunk, recording many four-track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue.

689,1995,April,19,Oklahoma City bombing - a truck bomb at Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building kills 168 & injures 500,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing,"The Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States, on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing happened at 9:02 am and killed at least 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed one-third of the building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652 million worth of damage. Local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies engaged in extensive rescue efforts in the wake of the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. Until the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States, and remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in the country's history.
Within 90 minutes of the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, a veteran of the Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives parked in front of the building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and unhappy about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.The official investigation, known as ""OKBOMB"", saw FBI agents conduct 28,000 interviews, amass 3.5 short tons (3,200 kg) of evidence, and collect nearly one billion pieces of information. The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997. McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001 at the U.S. Federal Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, and Nichols was sentenced to life in prison in 2004. Michael and Lori Fortier testified against McVeigh and Nichols; Michael was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to warn the United States government, and Lori received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony.
As a result of the bombing, the U.S. Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which tightened the standards for habeas corpus in the United States, as well as legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks. On April 19, 2000, the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated on the site of the Murrah Federal Building, commemorating the victims of the bombing. Remembrance services are held every year on April 19, at the time of the explosion.",set(),0,"['Oklahoma City', 'Alfred P. Murrah', 'Federal Building', 'Oklahoma City', 'the Alfred P.

693,1995,December,14,"The Dayton Agreement is signed in Paris by leaders of various governments ending the conflict in the former Yugoslavia including Slobodan Milošević, Alija Izetbegović, Franjo Tuđman and Bill Clinton",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87,"Slobodan Milošević (Serbo-Croatian: [slobǒdan milǒːʃeʋitɕ] (listen); Serbian Cyrillic: Слободан Милошевић; 20 August 1941 – 11 March 2006) was a Yugoslav and Serbian politician and statesman who served as the President of Serbia (originally the Socialist Republic of Serbia, a constituent republic within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) from 1989 to 1991 and within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1991 to 1997, and President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1997 to 2000. He led the Socialist Party of Serbia from its foundation in 1990 and rose to power as Serbian President during efforts to reform the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia in response to alleged marginalization of Serbia, views that the powers of Serbia's autonomous provinces were too strong making them almost independent from Serbia, and claims of political incapacity to deter Albanian separatist unrest in Serbia's autonomous province of Kosovo.
Milošević's presidency of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was marked by several major reforms to Serbia's constitution from the 1980s to the 1990s that reduced the powers of the autonomous provinces in Serbia. In 1990 Serbia transitioned from a Titoist one-party system to a multi-party system and attempted reforms to the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia. The constituent republics of the country split apart amid the outbreak of wars, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was founded by the former Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro. Milošević negotiated the Dayton Agreement on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs, which ended the Bosnian War in 1995.
During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Milošević was charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) with war crimes in connection to the wars in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo. He became the first sitting head of state to be charged with war crimes. Milošević resigned from the Yugoslav presidency amid demonstrations following the disputed presidential election of 24 September 2000, and he was arrested by Yugoslav federal authorities on 31 March 2001 on suspicion of corruption, abuse of power, and embezzlement. The initial investigation into Milošević faltered for lack of evidence, prompting the Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić to extradite him to the ICTY to stand trial for charges of war crimes instead. At the outset of the trial, Milošević denounced the Tribunal as illegal because it had not been established with the consent of the United Nations General Assembly; therefore he refused to appoint counsel for his defence. Milošević conducted his own defence in the five-year-long trial, which ended without a verdict when he died in his prison cell in The Hague on 11 March 2006. Milošević suffered from heart ailments and hypertension, and died of a heart attack. The Tribunal denied any responsibility for Milošević's death and stated that he had refused to take prescribed medicines and medicated himself instead.After Milošević's death, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) concluded separately in the Bosnian Genocide Case that there was no evidence linking him to genocide committed by Bosnian Serb forces during the Bosnian War. However, the Court did find that Milošević and others in Serbia had committed a breach of the Genocide Convention by failing to prevent the genocide from occurring and for not cooperating with the ICTY in punishing the perpetrators of the genocide, in particular General Ratko Mladić, and for violating its obligation to comply with the provisional measures ordered by the Court. Milošević's rule has been described by observers as authoritarian or autocratic, as well as kleptocratic, with numerous accusations of electoral frauds, political assassinations, suppression of press freedom and police brutality.","{1026, 2564, 2053, 1029, 7, 4100, 528, 2587, 1566, 2079, 1058, 550, 1584, 4661, 1590, 2104, 1081, 1595, 576, 580, 1622, 2647, 3676, 1633, 2152, 1649, 3699, 3702, 3192, 3195, 2686, 3199, 1162, 4235, 2703, 144, 3217, 663, 1688, 1177, 3745, 1192, 3243, 1709, 1714, 3777, 1228, 4307, 2261, 1251, 2278, 748, 1780, 3322, 1789, 255, 3842, 1288, 4372, 2330, 4895, 2336, 310, 4413, 1857, 2369, 1350, 843, 1867, 2388, 2901, 3413, 4445, 2910, 355, 3431, 4971, 2924, 889, 4993, 4994, 1924, 903, 2443, 2955, 3979, 2962, 3476, 4516, 3500, 4526, 2487, 1979, 3008, 452, 964, 3524, 1483, 2004, 3034, 1502, 1508, 2026, 3578, 4605}",105,"['The Dayton Agreement', 'Paris', 'Yugoslavia', 'Slobodan Milošević', 'Alija Izetbegović', 'Franjo Tuđman', 'Bill Clinton', 'Slobodan Milošević', 'Serbian', 'Слободан Милошевић', '20 August 1941', 'March 2006', 'Yugoslav', 'Serbian', 'Serbia', 'the Socialist Republic of Serbia', 'the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia', '1989 to 1991', 'the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia', '1991 to 1997', 'the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia', '1997 to 2000', 'the Socialist Party of Serbia', '1990', 'Serbian', '1974', 'Constitution of Yugoslavia', 'Serbia', 'Serbia', 'Serbia', 'Albanian', 'Serbia', 'Kosovo', 'Serbia', 'the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia', 'Serbia', 'the 1980s to the 1990s', 'Serbia', '1990', 'Serbia', 'Titoist', 'the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia', 'the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia', 'Yugoslav', 'Serbia', 'Montenegro', 'Milošević', 'the Dayton Agreement', 'the Bosnian Serbs', 'the Bosnian War', '1995', 'NATO', 'Yugoslavia', '1999', 'Milošević', 'the International Criminal Tribunal', 'Yugoslavia', 'Bosnia,', 'Croatia', 'Kosovo', 'Milošević', 'Yugoslav', '24 September 2000', 'Yugoslav', '31 March 2001', 'Milošević', 'Serbian', 'Zoran Đinđić', 'ICTY', 'Milošević', 'Tribunal', 'the United Nations General Assembly', 'Milošević', 'five-year-long', 'The Hague', '11 March 2006', 'Milošević', 'Tribunal', 'Milošević', 'Milošević', 'the International Court of Justice', 'the Bosnian Genocide Case', 'Bosnian Serb', 'the Bosnian War', 'Court', 'Milošević', 'Serbia', 'the Genocide Convention', 'ICTY', 'Ratko Mladić', 'Court', 'Milošević']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG']"

695,1995,October,3,"Former NFL running back, broadcaster and actor O.J. Simpson found not guilty of the murder of Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman in Los Angeles, California",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case,"The  O. J. Simpson murder case (officially People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson) was a criminal trial held in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Former National Football League (NFL) player, broadcaster and actor O. J. Simpson was tried on two counts of murder for the June 12, 1994 slashing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. At 12:10 a.m. on June 13, 1994, Brown and Goldman were found stabbed to death outside her condominium in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Simpson became a person of interest after police found a bloody glove behind his house and was formally charged with the murders on June 17. When he did not turn himself in at the agreed time (having previously been released after perfunctory questioning by police detectives), he became the object of a low-speed pursuit in a white 1993 Ford Bronco SUV owned and driven by his friend Al Cowlings. TV stations interrupted coverage of the NBA Finals to broadcast the incident. The pursuit was watched live by an estimated 95 million people. The pursuit, arrest, and trial were among the most widely publicized events in American history. The trial—often characterized as the trial of the century because of its international publicity—spanned eleven months, from the jury's swearing-in on November 9, 1994. Opening statements were made on January 24, 1995, and the verdict was announced on October 3, 1995, when Simpson was acquitted on two counts of murder. According to USA Today, the case has been described as the ""most publicized"" criminal trial in history.Simpson was represented by a high-profile defense team, also referred to as the ""Dream Team"", which was initially led by Robert Shapiro and subsequently directed by Johnnie Cochran. The team also included F. Lee Bailey, Alan Dershowitz, Robert Kardashian, Shawn Holley, Carl E. Douglas, and Gerald Uelmen. Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld were two additional attorneys who specialized in DNA evidence.
Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark, William Hodgman and later Christopher Darden thought that they had a strong case against Simpson, but Cochran was able to convince the jury that there was reasonable doubt concerning the validity of the State's DNA evidence, which was a relatively new form of evidence in trials at that time. The reasonable doubt theory included evidence that the blood sample had allegedly been mishandled by lab scientists and technicians, and there were questionable circumstances that surrounded other court exhibits. Cochran and the defense team also alleged other misconduct by the LAPD related to systemic racism and the actions of Detective Mark Fuhrman. Simpson's celebrity status, racial issues, and the lengthy televised trial riveted national attention. 
The trial became historically significant because of the reaction to the verdict. The nation observed the same evidence presented at trial but a division along racial lines emerged in observers opinion of the verdict, which the media dubbed the ""racial gap"". A poll of Los Angeles County residents showed that most African Americans felt that justice had been served by the ""not guilty"" verdict, while the majority of whites and Latinos felt it was a racially motivated jury nullification by a predominantly African American jury. Polling shows the gap has narrowed since the trial, with over half of polled black respondents in 2015 stating that they believe Simpson was guilty.After the trial, the families of Brown and Goldman filed a lawsuit against Simpson. On February 4, 1997, the jury unanimously found Simpson responsible for both deaths. The families were awarded compensatory and punitive damages totaling $33.5 million  ($53.4 million in 2019 dollars), but have received only a small portion of that monetary figure. In 2000, Simpson left California for Florida, one of the few states where personal assets such as homes and pensions cannot be seized to cover liabilities that were incurred in other states.","{1026, 515, 1031, 2568, 7, 1038, 1041, 1555, 3091, 4115, 1562, 1563, 2076, 28, 1566, 1058, 3621, 550, 1576, 3625, 1066, 4649, 2092, 4140, 1584, 565, 2104, 4154, 1084, 4671, 576, 580, 70, 3656, 2637, 595, 1109, 1111, 2647, 2649, 3676, 1633, 3682, 3171, 612, 3174, 2152, 620, 1133, 1137, 2170, 3195, 4734, 640, 4235, 3727, 663, 1178, 4255, 4768, 2721, 2210, 1701, 4774, 1192, 1193, 3755, 1709, 1711, 176, 4785, 703, 4287, 2241, 3777, 2245, 1222, 4807, 1740, 1742, 3795, 4307, 1240, 4829, 2274, 1251, 3299, 1765, 3811, 2793, 748, 1272, 3322, 767, 3842, 1795, 4868, 1288, 269, 793, 283, 287, 4895, 802, 4899, 805, 1830, 1319, 4905, 2346, 1323, 3371, 815, 4400, 2865, 4407, 2874, 4413, 2878, 1346, 2372, 843, 2379, 1357, 2382, 2891, 338, 2898, 2388, 2901, 4437, 1372, 861, 1888, 2916, 1386, 4971, 3437, 2415, 885, 1397, 889, 1403, 4990, 4480, 4992, 386, 3459, 900, 3970, 4993, 4487, 4994, 2955, 3468, 5003, 5010, 3489, 4516, 424, 936, 5033, 1452, 1455, 4017, 2487, 1466, 1979, 5052, 3005, 1471, 452, 964, 1990, 968, 2504, 1997, 2509, 4558, 4561, 2004, 5077, 471, 4056, 3034, 1502, 3553, 5092, 2026, 3054, 1526, 1015, 504, 3578, 2555, 4605}",196,"['NFL', 'O.J.

Honorific nicknames were used in classical music in Europe as early as the early nineteenth century, with figures such as Mozart being called ""The father of modern music"" and Bach ""The father of modern piano music"". They were also particularly prominent in African-American culture in the post-Civil War era, perhaps as a means of conferring status that had been negated by slavery, and as a result entered early jazz and blues music, including figures such as Duke Ellington and Count Basie.In U.S. culture, despite its republican constitution and ideology, honorific nicknames have been used to describe leading figures in various areas of activity, such as industry, commerce, sports, and the media; father or mother have been used for innovators, and royal titles such as king and queen for dominant figures in a field. In the 1930s and 1940s, as jazz and swing music were gaining popularity, it was the more commercially successful white artists Paul Whiteman and Benny Goodman who became known as ""The King of Jazz"" and ""The King of Swing"" respectively, despite there being more highly regarded contemporary African-American artists. These patterns of naming were transferred to rock and roll when it emerged in the 1950s. There was a series of attempts to find (and a number of claimants to be) the ""King of Rock 'n' Roll"", a title that became most associated with Elvis Presley. This has been characterized as part of a process of the appropriation of credit for innovation of the then new music by a white establishment. Different honorifics have been taken or given for other leading figures in the genre, such as ""The Architect of Rock and Roll"", by Little Richard from the 1990s, but this term, like many, is also used for other important figures, in this case including pioneer electric guitarist Les Paul.Similar honorific nicknames have been given in other genres, including Aretha Franklin, who was literally crowned ""Queen of Soul"" by disk jockey Pervis Spann on stage in 1968. Michael Jackson and Madonna have been closely associated with the terms ""King and Queen of Pop"" since the 1980s. Some nicknames have been strongly promulgated and contested by various artists and occasionally disowned or played down by their subjects. Some notable honorific nicknames are in general usage and commonly identified with particular individuals.",set(),0,"['Björk', 'Europe', 'Mozart', 'Bach', 'African-American', 'Duke Ellington', 'Count Basie', 'U.S.', 'republican', 'the 1930s and 1940s', 'Paul Whiteman', 'Benny Goodman', 'The King of Jazz', '""The King of Swing""', 'African-American', 'the 1950s', 'Elvis Presley', 'The Architect of Rock and Roll', 'Richard', 'the 1990s', 'pioneer electric', 'Les Paul', 'Aretha Franklin', '""Queen of Soul', 'Pervis Spann', '1968', 'Michael Jackson', 'Madonna', 'the 1980s']","['ORG', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"

699,1995,October,2,"British band Oasis release their second studio album ""(What's the Story) Morning Glory?"", sells record 347,000 copies 1st week",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britpop,"Britpop was a mid-1990s UK-based music and culture movement that emphasised Britishness. It produced brighter, catchier alternative rock, partly in reaction to the popularity of the darker lyrical themes of the US-led grunge music and to the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The movement brought British alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger British popular cultural movement, Cool Britannia, which evoked the Swinging Sixties and the British guitar pop of that decade.
Britpop was a media-driven focus on bands which emerged from the independent music scene of the early 1990s. Although the term was viewed as a marketing tool, and more of a cultural moment than a musical style or genre, its associated bands typically drew from the British pop music of the 1960s, glam rock and punk rock of the 1970s and indie pop of the 1980s.
The most successful bands linked with Britpop were Blur, Oasis, Suede and Pulp, known as the movement's ""big four"", although Suede and Pulp distanced themselves from the term. The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993–1997, and its peak years to be 1994–1995. A chart battle between Blur and Oasis (dubbed ""The Battle of Britpop"") brought the movement to the forefront of the British press in 1995. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement.
By 1997, many Britpop acts began to falter commercially and break up, partly due to the popularity of the pop group the Spice Girls. Although Britpop's more popular bands were able to spread their commercial success overseas, the movement had largely fallen apart by the end of the decade.

700,1995,December,7,American rock band The Grateful Dead break up,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunions_of_the_Grateful_Dead,"The Grateful Dead were an American rock band known for their lengthy, partially improvised performances, as well as for a loyal fan base who often followed the band for several shows or entire tours. They disbanded in 1995, following the death of de facto bandleader Jerry Garcia.  Since then remaining members have reunited for a number of concert tours and one-off performances, often in very different configurations. The following is a list of instances where former Grateful Dead members have reunited.
Other than Jerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead's main performing members were Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart. Garcia, Weir, Lesh and Kreutzmann were in the band from its inception in 1965 until its demise in 1995, while Hart had a tenure of 25 non-consecutive years. The other then-current or former members of the Grateful Dead who were living at the time that the band broke up were Vince Welnick, Donna Jean Godchaux, and Tom Constanten.  Additionally, Bruce Hornsby was in the lineup for many Dead concerts and was considered an unofficial member of the band.  Already deceased in 1995 were Ron ""Pigpen"" McKernan, Keith Godchaux, and Brent Mydland.","{3842, 3459, 1026, 1795, 900, 7, 2568, 3978, 3468, 4112, 1170, 5010, 283, 3621, 1319, 1576, 3495, 815, 4400, 4785, 568, 1979, 703, 4671, 3139, 580, 2249, 75, 1228, 4558, 4437, 3927, 4829, 1248, 748, 4215, 1272, 889, 3322}",39,"['American', 'The Grateful Dead', 'The Grateful Dead', 'American', '1995', 'Jerry Garcia', 'Grateful Dead', 'Jerry Garcia', ""the Grateful Dead's"", 'Bob Weir', 'Phil Lesh', 'Bill Kreutzmann', 'Mickey Hart', 'Garcia', 'Weir', 'Lesh', 'Kreutzmann', '1965', '1995', 'Hart', 'the Grateful Dead', 'Vince Welnick', 'Donna Jean Godchaux', 'Tom Constanten', 'Bruce Hornsby', '1995', 'Ron', 'Keith Godchaux', 'Brent Mydland']","['NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON']"

The team won the Rugby World Cup in 2011 and 2015, as well as the inaugural tournament in 1987.
New Zealand has a 77 per cent winning record in test match rugby, and is the only international men's side to have secured more wins than losses against every opponent. Since their international debut in 1903, they have played test matches against 19 nations, of which 12 have never won a game against the All Blacks. The team has also played against three multinational all-star teams, losing only eight of 45 matches. Since the introduction of the World Rugby Rankings in 2003, New Zealand has held the number one ranking longer than all other teams combined. They jointly hold the record for the most consecutive test match wins for a tier one ranked nation, along with England.
The All Blacks compete with Argentina, Australia and South Africa in The Rugby Championship, and have won the trophy sixteen times in the competition's 23-year history. The team has completed a Grand Slam tour, against the four Home Nations, four times (1978, 2005, 2008 and 2010). New Zealand has been named the World Rugby Team of the Year ten times since the award was created in 2001, and an All Black has won the World Rugby Player of the Year award ten times over the same period. Fifteen former All Blacks have been inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame.
The team's first match was in 1884 in New South Wales, and their first international test match was in 1903 against Australia in Sydney. The following year, they hosted their first-ever home test, a match against a British Isles side in Wellington. This was followed by a 34-game tour of Europe and North America in 1905 (which included five test matches), where New Zealand suffered only one defeat: their first ever test loss, against Wales.
New Zealand's early uniforms consisted of a black jersey with a silver fern and white knickerbockers. By the 1905 tour, they were wearing all black, except for the silver fern, and the name ""All Blacks"" dates from this time. The team performs a haka before every match; this is a Māori challenge or posture dance, which has traditionally been Te Rauparaha's Ka Mate, although Kapa o Pango has also been performed since 2005.","{640, 1025, 4993, 1795, 2051, 1295, 3727, 3989, 1177, 4768, 290, 2210, 1828, 4134, 1960, 4905, 561, 2483, 3895, 2875, 4539, 4924, 4549, 1990, 967, 2122, 971, 2507, 4682, 4815, 467, 3795, 4307, 5077, 4824, 5080, 3834, 2141, 2018, 5092, 635, 874, 748, 4589, 1265, 2169, 4474, 3451, 5117}",49,"['the Rugby World Cup', 'Mike Catt', ""New Zealand's"", 'England', 'New Zealand', 'New Zealand', 'the Rugby World Cup', '2011', '2015', '1987', 'New Zealand', '1903', 'the World Rugby Rankings', '2003', 'New Zealand', 'England', 'Argentina', 'Australia', 'South Africa', 'The Rugby Championship', 'Grand Slam', 'Home Nations', '1978, 2005', '2008', '2010', 'New Zealand', 'the World Rugby Team', 'Year ten', '2001', 'the World Rugby Player of the Year', 'the same period', 'the International Rugby Hall of Fame', '1884', 'New South Wales', '1903', 'Australia', 'Sydney', 'The following year', 'British', 'Wellington', 'Europe', 'North America', '1905', 'New Zealand', 'Wales', ""New Zealand's"", '1905', 'Kapa o Pango', '2005']","['EVENT', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE']"

A member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, and a former World No. 1, she won three singles championships in Grand Slam tournaments and was the gold medalist at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Capriati set a number of youngest-ever records at the start of her career. She made her professional debut in 1990 at the age of 13 years, 11 months, reaching the final of the hard-court tournament in Boca Raton, Florida. Capriati reached the semifinals of the French Open in her debut and later became the youngest ever player to reach the top 10 at age 14 years, 235 days in October of that year. Following a first-round loss at the 1993 US Open, Capriati took a 14-month break from competitive pro tennis. Her personal struggles during this time (including arrests for shoplifting and possession of marijuana) were well-documented by the press.
In 1998, Capriati won her first Grand Slam singles match in five years at Wimbledon. During the next two years, Capriati slowly returned to championship form, winning her first title in six years in Strasbourg in 1999 and regaining a top-20 ranking. At the 2001 Australian Open, the reinvigorated Capriati became the lowest seed ever to win the championship when she defeated Martina Hingis in straight sets for her first Grand Slam championship. She also won the French Open that year, claiming the Women's Tennis Association No. 1 ranking in October. After successfully defending her Australian Open title in 2002, Capriati became a top-10 mainstay until injuries derailed her career in 2004.

704,1995,October,3,"Former NFL running back, broadcaster and actor O.J. Simpson found not guilty of the murder of Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman in Los Angeles, California",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case,"The  O. J. Simpson murder case (officially People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson) was a criminal trial held in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Former National Football League (NFL) player, broadcaster and actor O. J. Simpson was tried on two counts of murder for the June 12, 1994 slashing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. At 12:10 a.m. on June 13, 1994, Brown and Goldman were found stabbed to death outside her condominium in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Simpson became a person of interest after police found a bloody glove behind his house and was formally charged with the murders on June 17. When he did not turn himself in at the agreed time (having previously been released after perfunctory questioning by police detectives), he became the object of a low-speed pursuit in a white 1993 Ford Bronco SUV owned and driven by his friend Al Cowlings. TV stations interrupted coverage of the NBA Finals to broadcast the incident. The pursuit was watched live by an estimated 95 million people. The pursuit, arrest, and trial were among the most widely publicized events in American history. The trial—often characterized as the trial of the century because of its international publicity—spanned eleven months, from the jury's swearing-in on November 9, 1994. Opening statements were made on January 24, 1995, and the verdict was announced on October 3, 1995, when Simpson was acquitted on two counts of murder. According to USA Today, the case has been described as the ""most publicized"" criminal trial in history.Simpson was represented by a high-profile defense team, also referred to as the ""Dream Team"", which was initially led by Robert Shapiro and subsequently directed by Johnnie Cochran. The team also included F. Lee Bailey, Alan Dershowitz, Robert Kardashian, Shawn Holley, Carl E. Douglas, and Gerald Uelmen. Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld were two additional attorneys who specialized in DNA evidence.
Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark, William Hodgman and later Christopher Darden thought that they had a strong case against Simpson, but Cochran was able to convince the jury that there was reasonable doubt concerning the validity of the State's DNA evidence, which was a relatively new form of evidence in trials at that time. The reasonable doubt theory included evidence that the blood sample had allegedly been mishandled by lab scientists and technicians, and there were questionable circumstances that surrounded other court exhibits. Cochran and the defense team also alleged other misconduct by the LAPD related to systemic racism and the actions of Detective Mark Fuhrman. Simpson's celebrity status, racial issues, and the lengthy televised trial riveted national attention. 
The trial became historically significant because of the reaction to the verdict. The nation observed the same evidence presented at trial but a division along racial lines emerged in observers opinion of the verdict, which the media dubbed the ""racial gap"". A poll of Los Angeles County residents showed that most African Americans felt that justice had been served by the ""not guilty"" verdict, while the majority of whites and Latinos felt it was a racially motivated jury nullification by a predominantly African American jury. Polling shows the gap has narrowed since the trial, with over half of polled black respondents in 2015 stating that they believe Simpson was guilty.After the trial, the families of Brown and Goldman filed a lawsuit against Simpson. On February 4, 1997, the jury unanimously found Simpson responsible for both deaths. The families were awarded compensatory and punitive damages totaling $33.5 million  ($53.4 million in 2019 dollars), but have received only a small portion of that monetary figure. In 2000, Simpson left California for Florida, one of the few states where personal assets such as homes and pensions cannot be seized to cover liabilities that were incurred in other states.","{1026, 515, 1031, 2568, 7, 1038, 1041, 1555, 3091, 4115, 1562, 1563, 2076, 28, 1566, 1058, 3621, 550, 1576, 3625, 1066, 4649, 2092, 4140, 1584, 565, 2104, 4154, 1084, 4671, 576, 580, 70, 3656, 2637, 595, 1109, 1111, 2647, 2649, 3676, 1633, 3682, 3171, 612, 3174, 2152, 620, 1133, 1137, 2170, 3195, 4734, 640, 4235, 3727, 663, 1178, 4255, 4768, 2721, 2210, 1701, 4774, 1192, 1193, 3755, 1709, 1711, 176, 4785, 703, 4287, 2241, 3777, 2245, 1222, 4807, 1740, 1742, 3795, 4307, 1240, 4829, 2274, 1251, 3299, 1765, 3811, 2793, 748, 1272, 3322, 767, 3842, 1795, 4868, 1288, 269, 793, 283, 287, 4895, 802, 4899, 805, 1830, 1319, 4905, 2346, 1323, 3371, 815, 4400, 2865, 4407, 2874, 4413, 2878, 1346, 2372, 843, 2379, 1357, 2382, 2891, 338, 2898, 2388, 2901, 4437, 1372, 861, 1888, 2916, 1386, 4971, 3437, 2415, 885, 1397, 889, 1403, 4990, 4480, 4992, 386, 3459, 900, 3970, 4993, 4487, 4994, 2955, 3468, 5003, 5010, 3489, 4516, 424, 936, 5033, 1452, 1455, 4017, 2487, 1466, 1979, 5052, 3005, 1471, 452, 964, 1990, 968, 2504, 1997, 2509, 4558, 4561, 2004, 5077, 471, 4056, 3034, 1502, 3553, 5092, 2026, 3054, 1526, 1015, 504, 3578, 2555, 4605}",196,"['NFL', 'O.J.

709,1995,September,21,Actor and host Wayne Brady (23) divorces Diana Lasso after almost 2 years of marriage,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Russell_(singer),"Andy Russell (born Andrés Rábago; September 16, 1919 – April 16, 1992) was an American popular vocalist, actor, and entertainer of Mexican descent, specializing in traditional pop and Latin music. He sold 8 million records in the 1940s singing in a romantic, baritone voice and in his trademark bilingual English and Spanish style. He had chart-busters, such as ""Bésame Mucho"", ""Amor"", and ""What a Diff'rence a Day Made"". He made personal appearances and performed on radio programs, most notably Your Hit Parade, in several movies, and on television. During this initial phase of his career, his popularity in the United States rivaled that of crooners Frank Sinatra and Perry Como.
In 1954, he relocated to Mexico where he became a star of radio, television, motion pictures, records and nightclubs. He toured extensively throughout Latin America, Spain, Portugal and Cuba, and hosted the television variety program El Show de Andy Russell in Argentina from 1956–65.Upon returning to the United States, Russell continued to record. His 1967 single ""It's Such a Pretty World Today"" reached #1 on Billboard Magazine's Easy Listening Chart. In the ensuing years, Russell continued to perform in the United States and around the world, occasionally recording new records and making television appearances. Although well received, he did not achieve his previous level of success.During his 50-year career, Russell received many international accolades and awards, most notably being recognized as the original Latino crossover artist who introduced American audiences to popular songs sung in English and Spanish, thus opening the doors for later Hispanic bilingual artists to do the same. Through a fusion of musical styles, rhythms and languages, he created music that transcended borders and appealed to diverse audiences, becoming one of the first cross-cultural, multinational musical artists.","{4611, 1031, 2568, 7, 1038, 1041, 2579, 1562, 28, 2079, 1058, 4643, 550, 1576, 1584, 4661, 2104, 4154, 4671, 576, 2112, 1090, 580, 70, 583, 2119, 3656, 2131, 1109, 1622, 2645, 2647, 2649, 3676, 2141, 1633, 3682, 100, 2152, 1646, 1137, 1649, 3702, 2168, 2169, 2682, 3195, 127, 640, 130, 650, 1162, 2703, 3727, 663, 1177, 1178, 3228, 4255, 4768, 2721, 2723, 4774, 1192, 1193, 3243, 1709, 2221, 1711, 176, 4785, 2740, 703, 3777, 2245, 198, 1740, 3795, 4307, 1240, 1757, 4829, 1251, 3299, 1765, 3301, 3811, 3812, 3813, 4324, 748, 1272, 3322, 767, 257, 3842, 1795, 4868, 1288, 1292, 269, 287, 4895, 1830, 1319, 4905, 1323, 4400, 2865, 2869, 4920, 2874, 2878, 1346, 2372, 843, 2382, 4430, 2898, 851, 2388, 2901, 3413, 4437, 4445, 1888, 1890, 2916, 4967, 874, 4971, 3436, 3437, 367, 2415, 885, 1397, 889, 3449, 3451, 4990, 4480, 4993, 4994, 387, 900, 3459, 903, 4487, 2955, 3979, 3989, 423, 5033, 1452, 4526, 4017, 2483, 2487, 1466, 1979, 1471, 3519, 452, 964, 1477, 3524, 1997, 4558, 4051, 2004, 5077, 982, 471, 3034, 3553, 1508, 2026, 4589, 1526, 1015, 3578, 2555, 4605, 1022}",185,"['Wayne Brady', 'Diana Lasso', 'almost 2 years', 'Andy Russell', 'Andrés Rábago', 'September 16, 1919', 'April 16, 1992', 'American', 'Mexican', 'Latin', 'the 1940s', 'English', 'Spanish', 'Bésame Mucho', ""What a Diff'rence a Day Made"", 'the United States', 'Frank Sinatra', 'Perry Como', '1954', 'Mexico', 'Latin America', 'Spain', 'Portugal', 'Cuba', 'El Show de Andy Russell', 'Argentina', 'the United States', 'Russell', '1967', 'Today', ""Billboard Magazine's"", 'Easy Listening Chart', 'the ensuing years', 'Russell', 'the United States', 'Russell', 'Latino', 'American', 'English', 'Spanish', 'Hispanic']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LANGUAGE', 'NORP', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'LANGUAGE', 'LANGUAGE', 'NORP']"

Clinton, a Democrat from Arkansas, took office  following a decisive victory over Republican incumbent President George H. W. Bush and Independent businessman Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential election. Four years later, in the 1996 election, he defeated Perot and Republican Bob Dole to win re-election. He was succeeded by Republican George W. Bush, who won the 2000 presidential election.
The nation experienced an extended period of economic prosperity during the Clinton presidency. Months into his first term, he signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which raised taxes and set the stage for future budget surpluses. He won ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a trade pact negotiated by President George H. W. Bush among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Clinton's most ambitious legislative initiative, a plan to provide universal health care, never received a vote in Congress as he was unable to win sufficient congressional support for the policy. Republicans took control of Congress in the 1994 elections and Congressional Republicans led by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich proposed several conservative policies. Clinton vetoed many of these policies, but signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act into law.
In foreign policy, Clinton launched a major bombing campaign in the Balkans, which led to the creation of a United Nations protectorate in Kosovo. He played a major role of the expansion of NATO into former Eastern Bloc countries but remained on good terms with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. During his second term, Clinton presided over the establishment of the Children's Health Insurance Program and the deregulation of the financial and telecommunications industry. Clinton's second term saw the first federal budget surpluses since the 1960s, but was partially overshadowed by his impeachment in 1998. His impeachment arose after he denied having an affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Though the House of Representatives voted to impeach Clinton, he was acquitted of all charges by the Senate.
Clinton left office with high approval ratings, though his preferred successor, Vice President Al Gore, was narrowly defeated by Texas Governor George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential election. Since the end of Clinton's presidency, historians and political scientists have tended to rank Clinton as an above average president.","{1378, 4741}",2,"['US', 'Bill Clinton', 'Bill Clinton', 'January 20, 1993', 'Bill Clinton', 'the United States', 'January 20, 2001', 'Clinton', 'Democrat', 'Arkansas', 'Republican', 'George H.

Frances McDormand stars as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant Minnesota police chief investigating roadside homicides that ensue after a desperate car salesman (William H. Macy) hires two criminals (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife in order to extort a hefty ransom from his wealthy father-in-law (Harve Presnell).  The film was an international co-production between the United States and United Kingdom.
Fargo premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, where Joel Coen won the festival's Prix de la mise en scène (Best Director Award) and the film was nominated for the Palme d'Or. A critical and commercial success, Fargo received seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. McDormand received the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Coens won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.
The film was selected in 2006 for preservation in the National Film Registry of the United States by the Library of Congress as ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant""—one of only six films so designated in its first year of eligibility. In 1998, the American Film Institute named it one of the 100 greatest American films in history. A Coen-produced FX television series of the same name, inspired by Fargo and taking place in the same fictional universe, premiered in 2014 and received critical acclaim.","{4611, 2051, 4101, 7, 2568, 521, 528, 4113, 3090, 3098, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1058, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4140, 3630, 1584, 4661, 2104, 1081, 1084, 4671, 3139, 583, 4688, 1622, 2649, 3163, 2141, 2152, 2155, 3693, 1649, 2169, 2170, 2682, 3195, 640, 2703, 144, 1177, 154, 4768, 2213, 1197, 1709, 690, 4307, 3285, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3303, 4330, 748, 1272, 3322, 1275, 3842, 1795, 1292, 1808, 4895, 294, 1319, 4905, 3371, 4916, 311, 826, 1341, 3903, 1857, 2379, 4941, 4942, 2388, 4437, 1386, 4971, 3437, 4472, 889, 3451, 4993, 3970, 3459, 4994, 2955, 3979, 3989, 1432, 4007, 4526, 2483, 4024, 5059, 452, 964, 3524, 4549, 2507, 2508, 1997, 4558, 5067, 5077, 5079, 3034, 1502, 3040, 492, 4589, 5107, 2040, 3578, 4605}",121,"['Fargo', 'Joel', 'Ethan Coen', 'Frances McDormand', 'William H.

Jon Stewart then took over as the host from January 11, 1999, until August 6, 2015, making the show more strongly focused on political satire and news satire, in contrast with the pop culture focus during Kilborn's tenure. Stewart was succeeded by Trevor Noah, whose tenure premiered on September 28, 2015.  Under different hosts, the show has been formally known as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart from 1999 until 2015, and The Daily Show with Trevor Noah since 2015. The Daily Show is the longest-running program on Comedy Central (counting all three tenures), and has won 24 Primetime Emmy Awards.The program is popular among young audiences. The Pew Research Center suggested in 2010 that 74% of regular viewers were between 18 and 49, and that 10% of the audience watched the show for its news headlines, 2% for in-depth reporting, and 43% for entertainment; compared with respectively 64%, 10% and 4% who said the same of CNN.Critics chastised Stewart for not conducting sufficiently hard-hitting interviews with his political guests, some of whom he may have lampooned in previous segments. Stewart and other Daily Show writers responded to such criticism by saying that they do not have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians their only duty is to provide entertainment. Stewart's appearance on the CNN show Crossfire picked up this debate, where he chastised the CNN production and hosts for not conducting informative and current interviews on a news network.","{4611, 2568, 521, 3083, 1036, 528, 3090, 1562, 2076, 2589, 2078, 1566, 1058, 39, 551, 1576, 3630, 1584, 2104, 1081, 4671, 576, 3139, 4682, 4688, 1622, 2647, 2649, 2652, 3676, 4192, 1633, 2152, 1133, 4718, 1136, 3702, 2170, 3195, 2682, 2171, 640, 1153, 131, 4235, 3727, 144, 663, 154, 4768, 2210, 4770, 2213, 1192, 1711, 4785, 4287, 2241, 3777, 717, 3795, 4307, 3804, 3805, 4829, 1248, 1251, 2793, 4330, 748, 2798, 1783, 1272, 1275, 771, 1795, 1288, 1292, 3869, 4895, 2342, 1319, 4905, 3882, 4400, 4916, 309, 1341, 4413, 1857, 4941, 334, 2388, 2901, 4437, 1888, 4966, 1386, 4971, 4472, 4986, 4990, 4481, 3970, 3459, 3460, 4993, 4994, 903, 3979, 3468, 401, 4516, 5033, 3500, 4014, 2487, 4536, 4539, 5059, 964, 5065, 1483, 2508, 1997, 4558, 1999, 5067, 4561, 2004, 5077, 5079, 3544, 5080, 3034, 1502, 3040, 1508, 5092, 3046, 2026, 492, 1526, 2555}",144,"['The Daily Show', 'Craig Kilborn', 'Comedy Central', 'US', 'The Daily Show', 'American', 'Monday', 'Comedy Central', 'The Daily Show', 'July 21, 1996', 'Craig Kilborn', 'December 17, 1998', 'Jon Stewart', 'January 11, 1999', 'August 6, 2015', 'Stewart', 'Trevor Noah', 'September 28, 2015', 'The Daily Show', 'Jon Stewart', '1999', '2015', 'The Daily Show with Trevor Noah', '2015', 'The Daily Show', 'Comedy Central', 'The Pew Research Center', '2010', '74%', 'between 18 and 49', '10%', '2%', '43%', '64%', '10% and 4%', 'Stewart', 'Stewart', 'Daily Show', 'Stewart', 'CNN', 'Crossfire', 'CNN']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'PERCENT', 'PERCENT', 'PERCENT', 'PERCENT', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG']"
717,1996,January,29,"6,138th performance of ""Cats"" is held in London, surpassing record of Broadway's longest-running musical, ""A Chorus Line""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_(musical),"Cats is a sung-through musical composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, based on the 1939 poetry collection Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by T. S. Eliot. It tells the story of a tribe of cats called the Jellicles and the night they make the ""Jellicle choice,"" deciding which cat will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life. The musical includes the well-known song ""Memory"" as sung by Grizabella. As of 2019, Cats remains the fourth-longest-running Broadway show and the sixth-longest-running West End show.
Lloyd Webber began setting Eliot's poems to music in 1977 and the compositions were first presented as a song cycle in 1980. Producer Cameron Mackintosh then recruited director Trevor Nunn and choreographer Gillian Lynne to turn the songs into a complete musical. Cats opened to positive reviews at the New London Theatre in the West End in 1981 and then to mixed reviews at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in 1982. It won numerous awards including Best Musical at both the Laurence Olivier and Tony Awards. Despite its unusual premise that deterred investors initially, the musical turned out to be an unprecedented commercial success, with a worldwide gross of US$3.5 billion by 2012. 
The London production ran for 21 years and 8,949 performances, while the Broadway production ran for 18 years and 7,485 performances, making Cats the longest-running musical in both theatre districts for a number of years. Cats has since been revived in the West End twice and on Broadway once. It has also been translated into multiple languages and performed around the world many times. Long-running foreign productions include a 15-year run at the Operettenhaus in Hamburg that played over 6,100 performances, as well as an ongoing run in a purpose-built theatre in Japan that has played over 10,000 performances since it opened in 1983.
Cats started the megamusical phenomenon, establishing a global market for musical theatre and directing the industry's focus to big-budget blockbusters, as well as family- and tourist-friendly shows. The musical's profound but polarising influence also reshaped the aesthetic, technology, and marketing of the medium. Cats was adapted into a direct-to-video film in 1998, and a critically panned feature film adaptation directed by Tom Hooper in 2019.","{640, 3842, 387, 2322, 3989, 4768, 290, 1699, 1446, 4134, 2682, 4539, 4549, 202, 971, 1739, 2122, 2507, 4430, 4682, 4815, 595, 3803, 2141, 607, 3812, 873, 1388, 3180, 1646, 4589, 1136, 1908, 4474, 3451}",35,"['Cats', 'London', 'Broadway', 'Andrew Lloyd Webber', '1939', 'T.

719,1996,July,8,"British girls group the Spice Girls release their debut single ""Wannabe"" in the UK",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannabe,"""Wannabe"" is the debut single by English girl group the Spice Girls. Written and composed by the group members in collaboration with Matt Rowe and Richard ""Biff"" Stannard during the group's first professional songwriting session, it was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's debut album, Spice, released in November 1996. The song was written, composed, and recorded very quickly; but the result was considered lacklustre by their label, and was sent to be mixed by Dave Way. The group was not pleased with the result, and the recording was mixed again, this time by Mark ""Spike"" Stent.
""Wannabe"" is an uptempo dance-pop song which features Mel B and Geri Halliwell rapping. The lyrics, which address the value of female friendship over the heterosexual bond, became an iconic symbol of female empowerment and the most emblematic song of the group's Girl Power philosophy. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, the song won for Best British-Written Single at the 1997 Ivor Novello Awards and for British Single of the Year at the 1997 Brit Awards.
""Wannabe"" was heavily promoted by the group. Its music video, directed by Johan Camitz, became a big success on the British cable network The Box, which sparked press interest in the group. Subsequently, the song had intensive radio airplay across the United Kingdom, while the group performed it on television programmes and started doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines.
Responding to the wave of public interest in the group, Virgin released the song as the group's debut single in June 1996, well ahead of the planned release date of the Spice album. ""Wannabe"" topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and has received a double Platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The song was released in the United States in January 1997, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was the group's only number-one single in that country. By the end of 1996, ""Wannabe"" had topped the charts in 22 nations, and by March 1997 this number had climbed to 37. ""Wannabe"" became the best-selling single by a girl group in the world, with 1,385,211 and 2,910,000 copies sold in United Kingdom (by 2015) and United States (by 2014), respectively, and over 7 million copies worldwide by the end of 1997.

720,1996,August,6,Punk rock band the Ramones perform for the last time at the Palace in Hollywood,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramones,"The Ramones were an American punk rock band that formed in the New York City neighborhood of Forest Hills, Queens in 1974. They are often cited as the first true punk rock group. Despite achieving only limited commercial success initially, the band was highly influential in the United States and the United Kingdom.
All of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname ""Ramone"", although none of them were biologically related; they were inspired by Paul McCartney of The Beatles, who would check into hotels as ""Paul Ramon"". They performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years. In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band played a farewell concert and disbanded. By 2014, all four of the band's original members had died – lead singer Joey Ramone (1951–2001), bassist Dee Dee Ramone (1951–2002), guitarist Johnny Ramone (1948–2004) and drummer Tommy Ramone (1949–2014). The remaining surviving members of the Ramones – bassist C. J. Ramone and drummers Marky Ramone, Richie Ramone and Elvis Ramone – are still active as musicians.
Recognition of the band's importance built over the years, and they are now mentioned in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as number 26 in the Rolling Stone magazine list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"" and number 17 in VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"". In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by Spin, trailing only the Beatles. On March 18, 2002, the original four members and Tommy's replacement on drums, Marky Ramone, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on their first year of eligibility, though Joey had died by then. In 2011, the group was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.","{1025, 1538, 2051, 1539, 4101, 4611, 7, 2568, 524, 2590, 4134, 1576, 561, 584, 2122, 4682, 4174, 3151, 4688, 595, 1619, 1622, 2141, 3686, 1640, 3180, 1646, 1136, 1649, 2169, 2682, 127, 640, 4224, 1668, 1678, 2702, 2703, 3727, 1177, 4763, 4768, 677, 2214, 174, 690, 694, 202, 1739, 4815, 3795, 4307, 3799, 3803, 3812, 748, 1260, 1780, 3322, 3834, 1275, 3842, 1795, 1802, 1803, 1294, 1295, 4879, 3348, 3862, 290, 810, 1834, 1847, 4920, 826, 2368, 4426, 4940, 4430, 336, 1873, 2388, 3927, 4445, 1888, 1890, 873, 3434, 1388, 3951, 3954, 1907, 889, 4474, 3451, 4993, 387, 3459, 3463, 403, 3989, 1432, 4007, 1960, 2475, 1454, 2483, 3508, 4020, 4024, 4539, 1985, 4549, 1990, 967, 971, 2507, 2000, 5074, 4051, 5088, 2018, 997, 4589}",125,"['Ramones', 'Palace', 'Hollywood', 'Ramones', 'American', 'New York City', 'Forest Hills', 'Queens', '1974', 'the United States', 'the United Kingdom', 'Ramone', 'Paul McCartney', 'Paul Ramon', '22 years', '1996', 'the Lollapalooza music festival', '2014', 'Joey Ramone', 'Dee Dee Ramone', 'Johnny Ramone', 'Tommy Ramone', 'Ramones', 'C.

The fifth President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, was internationally condemned for his use of chemical weapons during the 1980s campaign against Iranian and Kurdish civilians during and after the Iran–Iraq War. In the 1980s, Saddam pursued an extensive biological weapons program and a nuclear weapons program, though no nuclear bomb was built. After the Persian Gulf War (1990–1991), the United Nations (with the Government of Iraq) located and destroyed large quantities of Iraqi chemical weapons and related equipment and materials; Iraq ceased its chemical, biological and nuclear programs.In the early 2000s, the administrations of George W. Bush and Tony Blair asserted that Saddam Hussein's weapons programs were still actively building weapons, and that large stockpiles of WMDs were hidden in Iraq. Inspections by the UN to resolve the status of unresolved disarmament questions restarted between November 2002 and March 2003, under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, which demanded Hussein give ""immediate, unconditional and active cooperation"" with UN and IAEA inspections, shortly before his country was attacked. The United States asserted that Hussein's frequent lack of cooperation was a breach of Resolution 1441, but failed to convince the United Nations Security Council to pass a new resolution authorizing the use of force due to lack of evidence. Despite this, Bush asserted peaceful measures could not disarm Iraq of the weapons he alleged it to have and launched a second Gulf War instead. A year later, the United States Senate officially released the Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq which concluded that many of the Bush Administration's pre-war statements about Iraqi WMD were misleading and not supported by the underlying intelligence. United States–led inspections later found that Iraq had earlier ceased active WMD production and stockpiling; the war was called by many, including 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain in a memoir, a ""mistake"".Iraq signed the Geneva Protocol in 1931, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1969, and the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972, but did not ratify it until June 11, 1991.

Her partner, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul, were pronounced dead at the scene. Their bodyguard, Trevor Rees-Jones, survived with serious injuries.
Media blamed the erratic behaviour of paparazzi following the car, as reported by the BBC contributed to the crash. In 1999, a French investigation found that Paul, who lost control of the vehicle at high speed while intoxicated and under the effects of prescription drugs, was solely responsible for the crash. He was the deputy head of security at the Hôtel Ritz and had earlier goaded paparazzi waiting for Diana and Fayed outside the hotel. Anti-depressants and traces of an anti-psychotic in his blood may have worsened Paul's inebriation. No evidence was found that paparazzi were near the car when it crashed. In 2008, the jury at a British inquest returned a verdict of unlawful killing through grossly negligent driving by Paul and following vehicles. It was also found that none of the occupants of the car were wearing a seat belt.Diana was 36 years old when she died. Her death caused an outpouring of grief in the United Kingdom and worldwide, and her funeral was watched by an estimated 2.5 billion people. The Royal Family were criticised in the press for their reaction to Diana's death. Public interest in Diana has remained high and she has retained regular press coverage in the years after her death.","{4611, 2051, 2052, 4101, 1555, 2590, 1058, 4642, 4134, 2092, 4140, 561, 1081, 4154, 2112, 2141, 613, 1642, 1646, 1136, 3186, 2169, 2682, 3195, 2171, 127, 3213, 1678, 1177, 2210, 3243, 1709, 1204, 3252, 695, 3268, 1739, 4815, 4307, 4824, 3803, 3812, 3814, 3834, 1275, 3324, 1803, 1295, 4879, 3862, 795, 3365, 810, 2861, 815, 4917, 310, 311, 4924, 2368, 4940, 4430, 1873, 2388, 3413, 1888, 1890, 3427, 873, 1386, 3434, 1388, 4971, 1907, 3451, 892, 387, 2955, 3979, 3481, 2982, 1960, 5033, 2483, 1979, 5059, 3524, 967, 2507, 4051, 4563, 3034, 4589, 1008, 3574, 2039, 5117}",97,"['Wales', 'Paris', 'Diana', 'Wales', 'Paris', 'France', 'Dodi Fayed', 'Henri Paul', 'Trevor Rees-Jones', 'BBC', '1999', 'French', 'Paul', 'Hôtel Ritz', 'Diana', 'Paul', '2008', 'British', 'Paul', 'Diana', '36 years old', 'the United Kingdom', 'The Royal Family', 'Diana', 'Diana', 'the years']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"

733,1997,September,16,Apple Computer Inc names co-founder Steve Jobs interim CEO,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs,"Steven Paul Jobs (; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. His declassified FBI report states that he used marijuana and LSD while he was in college, and once told a reporter that taking LSD was ""one of the two or three most important things"" he had done in his life.
Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple's members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated film Toy Story (1995).
Apple acquired NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few months. He was largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been at the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the ""Think different"" advertising campaign and leading to the iMac, iTunes, iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with a completely new Mac OS X, based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor at age 56 on October 5, 2011.","{2, 4611, 2051, 7, 2568, 531, 20, 1555, 4115, 1058, 1576, 4649, 2092, 4140, 563, 565, 4661, 1591, 4671, 1600, 1090, 580, 586, 3154, 595, 2141, 608, 612, 1133, 632, 2169, 2171, 130, 4235, 1168, 663, 152, 1177, 2210, 2722, 3243, 3244, 1709, 1711, 176, 177, 2735, 4785, 1222, 1228, 717, 1742, 1233, 4307, 4829, 3814, 748, 1272, 3322, 1275, 3842, 1795, 264, 1292, 290, 4899, 1319, 4400, 2355, 2869, 311, 1847, 826, 4413, 2379, 4944, 3413, 4437, 858, 1374, 355, 874, 4971, 3437, 1905, 370, 889, 1403, 4990, 4993, 3459, 2955, 3979, 1938, 5010, 1432, 5019, 3998, 5022, 4007, 424, 5033, 4526, 1455, 2483, 1979, 5052, 1475, 3524, 968, 2507, 4558, 2004, 471, 4056, 2018, 996, 5097, 3578, 4605}",120,"['Apple Computer Inc', 'Steve Jobs', 'Steven Paul Jobs', 'February 24, 1955', 'October 5, 2011', 'American', 'Apple Inc.', 'Pixar', ""The Walt Disney Company's"", 'Pixar', 'NeXT', 'Jobs', '1970s', '1980s', 'Apple', 'Steve Wozniak', 'San Francisco', 'California', 'the San Francisco Bay Area', 'Reed College', '1972', 'India', '1974', 'Zen Buddhism', 'FBI', 'marijuana', 'LSD', 'Wozniak co-', 'Apple', '1976', 'Wozniak', 'Apple', 'a year later', 'the Apple II', 'the Xerox Alto', '1979', 'Apple Lisa', '1983', 'Macintosh', '1984', 'Macintosh', '1985', 'the Apple LaserWriter', 'Jobs', 'Apple', '1985', 'John Sculley', 'That same year', 'Jobs', 'Apple', 'NeXT', ""George Lucas's"", 'Lucasfilm', '1986', 'Pixar', '3D', 'Toy Story', '1995', 'Apple', 'NeXT', '1997', 'Jobs', 'a few months', 'Apple', 'Jony', '1997', 'iMac', 'iTunes', 'iPod', 'iPhone', 'App Store', 'iPad', '2001', 'Mac OS', 'Mac OS X', 'NeXT', 'Jobs', '2003', 'age 56', 'October 5, 2011']","['ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE']"

The type with the greatest risk is highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Bird flu is similar to swine flu, dog flu, horse flu and human flu as an illness caused by strains of influenza viruses that have adapted to a specific host. Out of the three types of influenza viruses (A, B, and C), influenza A virus is a zoonotic infection with a natural reservoir almost entirely in birds. Avian influenza, for most purposes, refers to the influenza A virus.
Though influenza A is adapted to birds, it can also stably adapt and sustain person-to-person transmission. Recent influenza research into the genes of the Spanish flu virus shows it to have genes adapted from both human and avian strains. Pigs can also be infected with human, avian, and swine influenza viruses, allowing for mixtures of genes (reassortment) to create a new virus, which can cause an antigenic shift to a new influenza A virus subtype which most people have little to no immune protection against.Avian influenza strains are divided into two types based on their pathogenicity: high pathogenicity (HP) or low pathogenicity (LP). The most well-known HPAI strain, H5N1, appeared in China in 1996, and also has low pathogenic strains found in North America. Companion birds in captivity are unlikely to contract the virus and there has been no report of a companion bird with avian influenza since 2003. Pigeons can contract avian strains, but rarely become ill and are incapable of transmitting the virus efficiently to humans or other animals.Between early 2013 and early 2017, 916 lab-confirmed human cases of H7N9 were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). On 9 January 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China reported to WHO 106 cases of H7N9 which occurred from late November through late December, including 35 deaths, 2 potential cases of human-to-human transmission, and 80 of these 106 persons stating that they have visited live poultry markets.  The cases are reported from Jiangsu (52), Zhejiang (21), Anhui (14), Guangdong (14), Shanghai (2), Fujian (2) and Hunan (1).  Similar sudden increases in the number of human cases of H7N9 have occurred in previous years during December and January.",set(),0,"['Hong Kong', 'Avian', 'avian', 'influenza', 'influenza', 'HPAI', 'influenza', 'influenza', 'influenza', 'Avian', 'influenza', 'Spanish', 'Avian', 'influenza', 'HPAI', 'H5N1', 'China', '1996', 'North America', '2003', 'Between early 2013', 'H7N9', 'the World Health Organization', '9 January 2017', 'the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China', 'H7N9', 'late November through late December', 'Jiangsu', '52', 'Zhejiang', 'Anhui', 'Guangdong', 'Shanghai', 'Fujian', 'Hunan', 'H7N9', 'previous years', 'December', 'January']","['GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE']"

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, the film is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.
Cameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million.
Upon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success. Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve (1950) for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben-Hur (1959) for the most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark, and became the highest-grossing film ever at the time, until Cameron's Avatar surpassed it in 2010. A 3D version of Titanic, released on April 4, 2012, to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.18 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after Avatar). In 2017, the film was re-released for its 20th anniversary and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.","{3970, 3459, 1795, 3332, 4611, 2568, 2955, 3979, 4235, 2702, 1275, 3091, 2964, 3989, 1432, 4890, 290, 2210, 4134, 1319, 936, 1576, 4007, 5033, 1711, 4400, 1847, 4407, 4536, 826, 1979, 4920, 4413, 703, 4671, 4675, 452, 1990, 967, 1095, 4426, 1483, 2507, 4558, 1616, 467, 2004, 2388, 3451, 4307, 4437, 4445, 1502, 1888, 2018, 2274, 3046, 3686, 1642, 4971, 748, 1133, 4589, 4853, 1272, 2169, 3578, 2171, 4605, 4990}",70,"['James Cameron', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Kate Winslet', 'the Tokyo International Film Festival', '1998', '1997', 'American', 'James Cameron', 'the RMS Titanic', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Kate Winslet', 'Cameron', '1995', 'Cameron', 'Akademik Mstislav Keldysh', 'Cameron', 'Titanic', 'Baja Studios', 'Paramount Pictures', '20th Century Fox', 'North America', 'December 19, 1997', 'Academy Awards', '1950', 'Oscar', 'Ben-Hur', '1959', 'Oscars', 'Titanic', ""Cameron's Avatar"", '2010', 'Titanic', 'April 4, 2012', 'Avatar', '2017', 'the United States National Film Registry']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE']"

The first significant numbers arrived in the 1680s in New York and Pennsylvania. Some eight million German immigrants have entered the United States since that point. Immigration continued in substantial numbers during the 19th century; the largest number of arrivals moved 1840–1900, when Germans formed the largest group of immigrants coming to the U.S., outnumbering the Irish and English. Some arrived seeking religious or political freedom, others for economic opportunities greater than those in Europe, and others for the chance to start afresh in the New World. California and Pennsylvania have the largest populations of German origin, with more than six million German Americans residing in the two states alone. More than 50 million people in the United States identify German as their ancestry; it is often mixed with other Northern European ethnicities. This list also includes people of German Jewish descent.
Americans of German descent live in nearly every American county, from the East Coast, where the first German settlers arrived in the 17th century, to the West Coast and in all the states in between. German Americans and those Germans who settled in the U.S. have been influential in almost every field, from science, to architecture, to entertainment, and to commercial industry.","{4611, 1539, 7, 2568, 3091, 4115, 1566, 1058, 4642, 1576, 4140, 1584, 565, 4661, 2615, 2104, 4671, 2112, 4675, 580, 2119, 4682, 3151, 4688, 595, 1622, 612, 3686, 2152, 1646, 1649, 2169, 2682, 127, 640, 1668, 4235, 1678, 2191, 2703, 3727, 1177, 4768, 3243, 1709, 694, 2241, 3777, 1222, 1739, 1742, 3795, 4307, 3803, 3812, 3813, 748, 1780, 1272, 3322, 3842, 1795, 3332, 4871, 1802, 283, 4895, 1319, 4905, 3371, 4400, 4920, 826, 4923, 4413, 3907, 4426, 4430, 3413, 4437, 3927, 4445, 1888, 3427, 4971, 375, 889, 3451, 892, 4990, 4992, 4993, 4994, 387, 3459, 2955, 3979, 403, 2964, 1432, 4007, 424, 5033, 4526, 1455, 2483, 948, 1464, 4024, 4539, 5052, 452, 964, 3524, 1997, 4558, 4051, 2004, 4563, 5077, 4056, 5088, 4589, 3578, 4605}",125,"['Halle Berry', 'MLB', 'David Justice', '31', 'more than 4 years', 'German Americans', 'German', 'the United States', 'German', 'the United States', '17%', 'U.S.', 'the 1680s', 'New York', 'Pennsylvania', 'German', 'the United States', 'the 19th century', 'Germans', 'U.S.', 'Irish', 'English', 'Europe', 'California', 'Pennsylvania', 'German', 'German', 'Americans', 'the United States', 'German', 'Northern European', 'German', 'Jewish', 'Americans', 'German', 'American', 'the East Coast', 'German', 'the 17th century', 'the West Coast', 'German Americans', 'Germans', 'U.S.']","['PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERCENT', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LANGUAGE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE']"

He was a Saudi Arabian citizen until 1994 (stateless thereafter) and a member of the wealthy bin Laden family.Bin Laden's father was Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire from Hadhramaut, Yemen, and the founder of the construction company, Saudi Binladin Group. His mother, Alia Ghanem, was from a secular middle-class family based in Latakia, Syria. He was born in Saudi Arabia and studied at university in the country until 1979, when he joined Mujahideen forces in Pakistan fighting against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He helped to fund the Mujahideen by funneling arms, money and fighters from the Arab world into Afghanistan, and gained popularity among many Arabs. In 1988, he formed al-Qaeda. He was banished from Saudi Arabia in 1992, and shifted his base to Sudan, until U.S. pressure forced him to leave Sudan in 1996. After establishing a new base in Afghanistan, he declared a war against the United States, initiating a series of bombings and related attacks. Bin Laden was on the American Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) lists of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives and Most Wanted Terrorists for his involvement in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings.Bin Laden is most well known for his role in masterminding the September 11 attacks, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 and prompted the United States to initiate the War on Terror. He subsequently became the subject of a decade-long international manhunt. From 2001 to 2011, bin Laden was a major target of the United States, as the FBI offered a $25 million bounty in their search for him. On May 2, 2011, bin Laden was shot and killed by US Navy SEALs inside a private residential compound in Abbottabad, where he lived with a local family from Waziristan.  The covert operation was conducted by members of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (SEAL Team Six) and Central Intelligence Agency SAD/SOG operators on the orders of U.S. President Barack Obama.

It served as a major development in the Northern Ireland peace process of the 1990s. Northern Ireland's present devolved system of government is based on the agreement. The agreement also created a number of institutions between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Issues relating to sovereignty, civil and cultural rights, decommissioning of weapons, demilitarisation, justice and policing were central to the agreement.
The agreement was approved by voters across the island of Ireland in two referendums held on 22 May 1998. In Northern Ireland, voters were asked in the 1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum whether they supported the multi-party agreement. In the Republic of Ireland, voters were asked whether they would allow the state to sign the agreement and allow necessary constitutional changes (Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland) to facilitate it. The people of both jurisdictions needed to approve the agreement in order to give effect to it.
The British–Irish Agreement came into force on 2 December 1999.

It occurred as a provision of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement drawn up in 2010 (after a general election that had resulted in the first hung parliament since February 1974) and also indirectly in the aftermath of the 2009 expenses scandal. It operated under the provisions of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 and was the first national referendum to be held under provisions laid out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.
The referendum concerned whether or not to replace the present ""first-past-the-post"" system with the ""alternative vote"" (AV) method, and was the first national referendum to be held across the whole of the United Kingdom in the twenty-first century. The proposal to introduce AV was rejected by 67.9% of voters on a national turnout of 42%.
This was only the second UK-wide referendum to be held (the first was the EC referendum in 1975) and the first such to be overseen by the Electoral Commission. It is to date the only UK-wide referendum to be held on an issue not related to the European Communities or the European Union, and is also the first to have been not merely consultative: it committed the government to give effect to its decision.All registered electors over 18 (British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens living in the UK and enrolled British citizens living outside) – including members of the House of Lords (who cannot vote in UK general elections) – were entitled to take part.
On a turnout of 42.2 per cent, 68 per cent voted 'No' and 32 percent voted 'Yes'. Ten of the 440 local voting areas recorded 'Yes' votes above 50 per cent: four were Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh Central and Glasgow Kelvin, with the remaining six being in London.

Most central banks also have supervisory and regulatory powers to ensure the stability of member institutions, to prevent bank runs, and to discourage reckless or fraudulent behavior by member banks.

It took place on the A1 road at Buskhill in County Down, Northern Ireland. Five people were killed, including three members of The Miami Showband, who were one of Ireland's most popular cabaret bands.
The band was travelling home to Dublin late at night after a performance in Banbridge. Halfway to Newry, their minibus was stopped at what appeared to be a military checkpoint where gunmen in British Army uniforms ordered them to line up by the roadside. At least four of the gunmen were soldiers from the British Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), and all were members of the UVF. Two of the gunmen, both soldiers, died when the time bomb they were hiding on the minibus exploded prematurely. The other gunmen then opened fire on the dazed band members, killing three and wounding two. It has been suggested that the bomb was meant to explode en route, so that the victim band members would appear to be IRA bomb-smugglers and stricter security measures would be established at the border.
Two serving UDR soldiers and one former UDR soldier were found guilty of the murders and received life sentences; they were released in 1998. Those responsible for the attack belonged to the Glenanne gang, a secret alliance of loyalist militants, rogue police officers, and UDR soldiers. There are also allegations that British military intelligence agents were involved. According to former Intelligence Corps agent Captain Fred Holroyd, the killings were organised by British intelligence officer Robert Nairac, together with the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade and its commander Robin ""The Jackal"" Jackson. The Historical Enquiries Team investigated the killings and released their report to the victims' families in December 2011. It confirmed that Jackson was linked to the attack by fingerprints. Documentary evidence, published in 2015, clears Robert Nairac of participation as it determines he was not in Northern Ireland when the ambush took place.  That evidence has now been discredited following the recent release of heavily redacted Ministry of Defence papers which name Captain Nairac as the man who obtained uniforms and equipment for the killers.  These papers also indicate he organised and executed the massacre of the Miami Showband.

752,1998,October,16,Former Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet is arrested in London on a Spanish warrant requesting his extradition on murder charges,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet,"Augusto José Ramón Pinochet Ugarte (, also US: , UK: , Spanish: [auˈɣusto pinoˈ(t)ʃe(t)]; 25 November 1915 – 10 December 2006) was a Chilean general and politician who ruled as dictator of Chile from 1973 to 1990, first as the President of the Government Junta of Chile from 1973 to 1981, before being declared President of the Republic by the junta in 1974.Pinochet assumed power in Chile following a United States-backed coup d'état on 11 September 1973 that overthrew the democratically elected socialist Unidad Popular government of President Salvador Allende and ended civilian rule. The support of the United States was crucial to the coup and the consolidation of power afterward. Pinochet had been promoted to  Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army by Allende on 23 August 1973, having been its General Chief of Staff since early 1972. In December 1974, the ruling military junta appointed Pinochet Supreme Head of the nation by joint decree, although without the support of one of the coup's instigators, Air Force General Gustavo Leigh. Following his rise to power, Pinochet persecuted leftists, socialists, and political critics, resulting in the executions of from 1,200 to 3,200 people, the internment of as many as 80,000 people and the torture of tens of thousands. According to the Chilean government, the number of executions and forced disappearances was 3,095. Operation Condor was founded at the behest of the Pinochet regime in late November 1975, his 60th birthday.Under the influence of the free market-oriented ""Chicago Boys"", Pinochet's military government implemented economic liberalization, including currency stabilization, removed tariff protections for local industry, banned trade unions and privatized social security and hundreds of state-owned enterprises. Some of the government properties were sold below market price to politically connected buyers, including Pinochet's son-in-law. These policies produced high economic growth, but critics state that economic inequality dramatically increased and attribute the devastating effects of the 1982 monetary crisis on the Chilean economy to these policies. For most of the 1990s, Chile was the best-performing economy in Latin America, though the legacy of Pinochet's reforms continues to be in dispute. His fortune grew considerably during his years in power through dozens of bank accounts secretly held abroad and a fortune in real estate. He was later prosecuted for embezzlement, tax fraud and for possible commissions levied on arms deals.Pinochet's 17-year rule was given a legal framework through a controversial 1980 plebiscite, which approved a new constitution drafted by a government-appointed commission. In a 1988 plebiscite, 56% voted against Pinochet's continuing as president, which led to democratic elections for the presidency and Congress. After stepping down in 1990, Pinochet continued to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army until 10 March 1998, when he retired and became a senator-for-life in accordance with his 1980 Constitution. However, Pinochet was arrested under an international arrest warrant on a visit to London on 10 October 1998 in connection with numerous human rights violations. Following a legal battle, he was released on grounds of ill-health and returned to Chile on 3 March 2000. In 2004, Chilean Judge Juan Guzmán Tapia ruled that Pinochet was medically fit to stand trial and placed him under house arrest. By the time of his death on 10 December 2006, about 300 criminal charges were still pending against him in Chile for numerous human rights violations during his 17-year rule and tax evasion and embezzlement during and after his rule. He was also accused of having corruptly amassed at least US$28 million.","{2051, 2568, 521, 528, 1041, 2066, 3090, 4113, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1566, 1058, 4642, 39, 1576, 3630, 4661, 1081, 2112, 3139, 2628, 4688, 595, 1622, 2649, 2652, 2141, 4192, 2152, 2155, 1133, 1646, 4718, 1136, 1649, 3702, 3195, 2171, 640, 2176, 131, 650, 1678, 3727, 144, 1170, 154, 4768, 2721, 2210, 2213, 3243, 1709, 3777, 4807, 2764, 717, 3795, 4307, 4313, 3803, 3804, 3805, 3812, 3813, 3303, 4330, 748, 2798, 1783, 2297, 3322, 771, 1795, 3862, 3869, 4895, 290, 4899, 3365, 4905, 1323, 815, 4913, 4916, 309, 311, 2875, 1341, 830, 3903, 1857, 2891, 4941, 4430, 4942, 3413, 4437, 1888, 1890, 874, 1386, 3436, 4971, 4472, 889, 892, 4990, 4991, 4993, 3970, 387, 3459, 3460, 4994, 903, 2955, 3468, 3979, 401, 3500, 4014, 4526, 2483, 949, 4536, 1465, 3519, 5059, 452, 964, 1990, 3524, 4549, 5065, 5067, 2508, 1997, 4558, 5077, 982, 5079, 3544, 3034, 1502, 3040, 3046, 492, 5107, 2039, 2040, 3578, 4605}",154,"['Chilean', 'Augusto Pinochet', 'London', 'Spanish', 'Augusto José Ramón Pinochet Ugarte', 'US', 'UK', 'Spanish', '25 November 1915', 'December 2006', 'Chilean', 'Chile', '1973 to 1990', 'Chile', '1973 to 1981', 'Chile', 'United States', '11 September 1973', 'Unidad', 'Salvador Allende', 'the United States', 'the Chilean Army', 'Allende', '23 August 1973', 'early 1972', 'December 1974', 'Pinochet Supreme Head', 'Air Force', 'Gustavo Leigh', 'Pinochet', 'Chilean', 'Operation Condor', 'Pinochet', 'Chicago Boys""', 'Pinochet', 'Pinochet', '1982', 'Chilean', 'the 1990s', 'Chile', 'Latin America', 'Pinochet', 'his years', 'Pinochet', '1980', '1988', '56%', 'Pinochet', 'Congress', '1990', 'Pinochet', 'the Chilean Army', '10 March 1998', '1980', 'Constitution', 'Pinochet', 'London', '10 October 1998', 'Chile', '3 March 2000', '2004', 'Chilean', 'Juan Guzmán Tapia', 'Pinochet', '10 December 2006', 'Chile']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LANGUAGE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE']"

The main candidates were Hugo Chávez, a career military officer who led a coup d'état against then-president Carlos Andrés Pérez in 1992; and former Carabobo Governor Henrique Salas Römer. Both candidates represented newly formed parties, a first in a country where the main candidates always represented the parties of the Punto Fijo Pact. Chávez represented MVR, while Salas Römer represented Project Venezuela. Initially weak in the polls, Chávez ran on an anti-corruption and anti-poverty platform, condemning the two major parties that had dominated Venezuelan politics since 1958; and began to gain ground in the polls after the previous front runners faded. Despite the fact that the major parties (COPEI and Democratic Action) endorsed Salas Römer, Chávez was elected into his first term as President of Venezuela.
A realigning election, the result meant the end of the Puntofijismo that had dominated the political atmosphere of the country in the last 40 years, and the beginning of the dominance of the new MVR party (later renamed PSUV).","{3970, 2051, 387, 892, 2955, 1678, 1557, 3862, 3989, 1177, 290, 2210, 4134, 2483, 2740, 4024, 967, 1483, 1739, 2507, 4430, 1746, 4051, 2004, 2388, 4307, 4691, 3803, 2141, 4445, 1888, 3812, 744, 873, 4971, 1388, 4589, 1646, 1136, 2169, 2682, 3451, 2684, 4605, 127}",45,"['Hugo Chávez', 'Venezuela', 'Venezuela', '6 December 1998', 'Hugo Chávez', 'Carlos Andrés Pérez', '1992', 'Carabobo', 'Henrique Salas', 'the Punto Fijo Pact', 'Chávez', 'MVR', 'Salas Römer', 'Venezuela', 'Chávez', 'Venezuelan', '1958', 'COPEI', 'Democratic Action', 'Salas Römer', 'Chávez', 'Venezuela', 'Puntofijismo', 'the last 40 years', 'MVR party']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG']"

The operation was a major flare-up in the Iraq disarmament crisis. The stated goal of the cruise missile and bombing attacks was to strike military and security targets in Iraq that contributed to Iraq's ability to produce, store, maintain, and deliver weapons of mass destruction. The bombing campaign had been anticipated since February 1998 and incurred wide-ranging criticism and support, at home and abroad.

757,1998,June,6,"TV sitcom ""Sex and the City"" premieres in the US on HBO, starring Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City,"Sex and the City is an American romantic comedy-drama television series created by Darren Star for HBO. It is an adaptation of Candace Bushnell's 1997 book of the same name. The series premiered in the United States on June 6, 1998, and concluded on February 22, 2004, with 94 episodes broadcast over six seasons. Throughout its development, the series received contributions from various producers, screenwriters, and directors, principally Michael Patrick King.
Set and filmed in New York City, the show follows the lives of a group of four women—three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties—who, despite their different natures and ever-changing sex lives, remain inseparable and confide in each other. Starring Sarah Jessica Parker (as Carrie Bradshaw) and co-starring Kim Cattrall (as Samantha Jones), Kristin Davis (as Charlotte York), and Cynthia Nixon (as Miranda Hobbes), the series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as sexuality, safe sex, promiscuity, and femininity, while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships. The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers' way of exploring social life—from sex to relationships—through each of their four very different, individual perspectives.
Sex and the City has received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters, and is credited with helping to increase HBO's popularity as a network. The series has won several accolades, including seven of its 54 Emmy Award nominations, eight of its 24 Golden Globe Award nominations, and three of its 11 Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. The series placed fifth on Entertainment Weekly's ""New TV Classics"" list, and has been listed as one of the best television series of all time by Time in 2007 and TV Guide in 2013.The series still airs in syndication worldwide. It spawned two feature films, Sex and the City (2008) and Sex and the City 2 (2010), and a prequel television series commissioned by The CW, The Carrie Diaries (2013–2014).","{4611, 1539, 4101, 7, 2568, 521, 524, 528, 4113, 3090, 3091, 1562, 2589, 2078, 4642, 4134, 39, 1576, 2601, 4647, 1602, 2628, 4688, 593, 3154, 595, 1622, 2649, 97, 3686, 1640, 619, 2155, 1136, 1649, 1653, 2169, 2170, 640, 2176, 4736, 131, 2702, 2703, 3727, 157, 4768, 2210, 2213, 174, 690, 694, 2764, 717, 3277, 3795, 4307, 4313, 3804, 3805, 3808, 2789, 3303, 4330, 748, 1783, 3322, 1275, 4859, 3842, 1795, 1808, 3346, 3869, 4895, 290, 3874, 294, 1319, 4905, 2862, 4400, 4916, 310, 311, 1847, 826, 2875, 319, 3903, 3908, 4426, 4941, 4942, 2388, 3927, 3427, 874, 3951, 3954, 4472, 889, 3449, 3451, 4474, 4990, 4993, 386, 3459, 3460, 3970, 4994, 2439, 3978, 2955, 3979, 401, 403, 2964, 3989, 1432, 4007, 5033, 4014, 3508, 4020, 4024, 2489, 5059, 452, 4549, 1990, 5065, 971, 2507, 1997, 2508, 5067, 5077, 5079, 2525, 1502, 3040, 5088, 2537, 492, 4589, 5106, 5107, 2040, 4605}",151,"['US', 'HBO', 'Sarah Jessica Parker', 'Kim Cattrall', 'Kristin Davis', 'Cynthia Nixon', 'American', 'Darren Star', 'HBO', ""Candace Bushnell's"", '1997', 'the United States', 'June 6, 1998', 'February 22, 2004', 'six seasons', 'Michael Patrick King', 'New York City', 'Sarah Jessica Parker', 'Carrie Bradshaw', 'Kim Cattrall', 'Samantha Jones', 'Kristin Davis', 'Charlotte York', 'Cynthia Nixon', 'Miranda Hobbes', 'HBO', 'Emmy Award', 'Golden Globe Award', 'Screen Actors Guild Award', ""Entertainment Weekly's"", 'New TV Classics', 'Time', '2007', 'TV Guide', 'prequel', 'The CW', 'The Carrie Diaries']","['GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'LOC']"
758,1998,October,20,Comedian Richard Pryor is awarded the 1st ever Mark Twain Prize for American Humour,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin,"George Denis Patrick Carlin (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, amateur philosopher, author, and social critic. He was known for his black comedy and reflections on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and various taboo subjects. He and his ""seven dirty words"" comedy routine were central to the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, in which a 5–4 decision affirmed the government's power to regulate indecent material on the public airwaves. Widely regarded as one of the most important and influential American stand-up comics of all time, Carlin was dubbed by one newspaper to be ""the dean of counterculture comedians"".The first of Carlin's 14 stand-up comedy specials for HBO was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, Carlin's routines focused on sociocultural criticism of American society. He often commented on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the excesses of American culture. He was a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show during the three-decade Johnny Carson era, and hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live in 1975.

759,1998,August,25,"""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"" debut album by Lauryn Hill is released (5 Grammy Awards including Album of the Year, Billboard Album of the Year 1998)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miseducation_of_Lauryn_Hill,"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is the debut solo album by American singer and rapper Lauryn Hill. It was released on August 25, 1998, by Ruffhouse Records and Columbia Records. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is a neo soul and R&B album with some songs based in hip hop soul and reggae. Its lyrics touch upon Hill's pregnancy and the turmoil within her former group the Fugees, along with themes of love and God. The album's title was inspired by the film and autobiographical novel The Education of Sonny Carson, and Carter G. Woodson's The Mis-Education of the Negro.
After touring with the Fugees, Hill became involved in a romantic relationship with Jamaican entrepreneur Rohan Marley, and shortly after, became pregnant with their child. This pregnancy, as well as other circumstances in her life, inspired Hill to make a solo album. Recording sessions for the album took place from late 1997 to June 1998 mainly at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, as Hill collaborated with a group of musicians known as New Ark in writing and producing the songs. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 422,624 copies in its first week, which broke a record for first-week sales by a female artist. It was promoted with three hit singles: ""Doo Wop (That Thing)"", ""Ex-Factor"", and ""Everything Is Everything"". ""Doo Wop (That Thing)"", the lead single, peaked at number one in the US, with the latter two singles peaking within the top 40. To further promote the album, Hill made televised performances on Saturday Night Live and the Billboard Music Awards before embarking on a sold-out, worldwide concert tour.
Critics generally praised The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill for Hill's presentation of a woman's view on life and love, along with her artistic range. At the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill earned 10 nominations, winning five awards, making Hill the first woman to receive that many nominations and awards in one night. The album's success propelled Hill to international superstardom, and contributed to bringing hip hop and neo soul to the forefront of popular music. New Ark, however, felt Hill and her record label did not properly credit the group on the album; a lawsuit filed by the group was settled out of court in 2001. Since its original release, the record has been ranked in numerous best-album lists, with a number of critics regarding it as one of the greatest albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2013, the album reached sales of 8 million copies in the US and over 19 million copies worldwide. Two years later, it was included by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry. It remains Hill's only studio album.","{1025, 4611, 2051, 4101, 2568, 521, 524, 528, 4113, 3090, 3608, 1562, 2589, 2078, 2080, 1569, 4643, 1573, 4134, 4647, 1576, 1583, 2096, 563, 1081, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4174, 4688, 3154, 595, 3666, 2652, 2141, 1631, 4704, 1633, 3174, 3686, 2155, 3180, 1133, 1646, 1136, 1649, 1653, 2169, 2171, 640, 1153, 2176, 131, 4736, 4745, 1678, 1167, 2703, 3727, 1177, 4768, 2210, 4775, 4268, 174, 175, 1711, 182, 699, 1739, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 4313, 4825, 3803, 3805, 1251, 3812, 3303, 2793, 2794, 748, 1260, 2798, 1783, 3322, 4859, 3842, 1795, 1288, 1808, 3348, 3862, 3869, 4895, 290, 3874, 807, 1319, 2856, 4905, 4910, 4400, 4916, 309, 311, 1847, 826, 2875, 4924, 830, 3908, 1867, 4430, 1888, 1890, 870, 873, 1388, 2415, 3951, 889, 4474, 3451, 892, 4990, 4993, 3970, 387, 3460, 1925, 3978, 2955, 5008, 401, 1938, 3989, 1432, 418, 4007, 5033, 4014, 2483, 2995, 4020, 1979, 4539, 1982, 3524, 965, 1990, 967, 4549, 5065, 971, 2507, 1997, 2508, 4561, 5074, 467, 5077, 3544, 2525, 3040, 2018, 1508, 2026, 492, 5106, 1526, 2039}",176,"['The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill', 'Lauryn Hill', 'Billboard Album', 'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill', 'American', 'Lauryn Hill', 'August 25, 1998', 'Ruffhouse Records', 'Columbia Records', 'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill', 'R&B', 'Hill', 'Fugees', 'The Education of Sonny Carson', ""Carter G.

He is the current manager of La Liga club Real Madrid. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Zidane was an elite playmaker renowned for his elegance, vision, passing, ball control, and technique. He received many individual accolades as a player, including being named FIFA World Player of the Year in 1998, 2000 and 2003, and won the 1998 Ballon d'Or. He was voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year in 1996, Serie A Footballer of the Year in 2001, and La Liga Best Foreign Player in 2002.
Zidane started his career at Cannes before establishing himself as one the best players in the French Division 1 at Bordeaux. In 1996, he moved to Juventus where he won trophies including two Serie A titles. He moved to Real Madrid for a world record fee at the time of €77.5 million in 2001, which remained unmatched for the next eight years. In Spain, Zidane won several trophies, including a La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League. In the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final, he scored a left-foot volleyed winner which is considered to be one of the greatest goals in the competition's history.Capped 108 times by France, Zidane won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, scoring twice in the final, and was named to the All-Star Team. This triumph made him a national hero in France, and he received the Légion d'honneur in 1998. He won UEFA Euro 2000, and was named Player of the Tournament. He also received the Golden Ball for Player of the Tournament at the 2006 World Cup, despite his infamous sending off in the final against Italy for headbutting Marco Materazzi in the chest. He retired as the fourth-most capped player in France history.
In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the world's greatest living players compiled by Pelé, and in the same year was named the best European footballer of the past 50 years in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll. Zidane is one of eight players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d'Or. He was the ambassador for Qatar's successful bid to stage the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the first Arab country to host the tournament.After retiring as a player, Zidane transitioned into coaching, and began his head coaching career at Real Madrid Castilla. He remained in the position for two years before taking the helm of the first team in January 2016. In his initial two and a half seasons with Madrid, Zidane won the UEFA Champions League an unprecedented three times consecutively, won the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup twice each, as well as a La Liga title, and a Supercopa de España. This success led to Zidane being named Best FIFA Men's Coach in 2017, but he resigned in May 2018. Following poor results by the club in the subsequent months, Zidane returned to Real Madrid as manager in March 2019.",{4741},1,"['FIFA World Cup Final', 'Stade de France', 'Saint-Denis', 'Zinadine Zidane', 'France', 'World Cup', 'Brazil', 'Zinedine Yazid Zidane', 'French', '\u200b[zinedin', '23 June 1972', 'French', 'Zizou', 'French', 'La Liga', 'Real Madrid', 'Zidane', 'FIFA World Player', '1998', '2000', '2003', '1998', 'Ballon', 'Ligue 1', 'the Year in 1996', 'Serie A Footballer', '2001', 'La Liga Best Foreign Player', '2002', 'Cannes', 'the French Division 1', 'Bordeaux', '1996', 'Juventus', 'Serie', 'Real Madrid', '2001', 'the next eight years', 'Spain', 'Zidane', 'La Liga', 'the UEFA Champions League', 'the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final', 'France', 'Zidane', '1998', 'FIFA World Cup', 'the All-Star Team', 'France', '1998', 'UEFA Euro 2000', 'Player of the Tournament', 'the Golden Ball for Player of the Tournament', 'the 2006', 'World Cup', 'Italy', 'Marco Materazzi', 'France', '2004', 'FIFA', '100', 'Pelé', 'the same year', 'European', 'the past 50 years', 'Zidane', 'the FIFA World Cup', 'the UEFA Champions League', 'Qatar', 'FIFA World Cup', 'Arab', 'Zidane', 'Real Madrid Castilla', 'two years', 'January 2016', 'two and a half seasons', 'Madrid', 'Zidane', 'the UEFA Champions League', 'the UEFA Super Cup', 'World Cup', 'La Liga', 'Supercopa de España', 'Zidane', ""Best FIFA Men's Coach"", '2017', 'May 2018', 'the subsequent months', 'Zidane', 'Real Madrid', 'March 2019']","['ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'FAC', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"

Barr began her career in stand-up comedy before gaining acclaim in the television sitcom Roseanne (1988–1997; 2018). She won an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her work on the show.
Barr became a stand-up comedian in 1980. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she gained fame through her role in Roseanne and other performances. Barr sparked controversy when performing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" at a nationally aired baseball game on July 25, 1990. After singing the anthem in what many perceived to be a deliberately disrespectful manner, Barr grabbed her groin and spat. This performance was met with condemnation from baseball fans and sportswriters, and was called ""disgraceful"" by then-President George H. W. Bush.Barr has been active and outspoken on political issues. She won nearly 70,000 votes for president in the general election of 2012, as the presidential nominee of the left-wing Peace and Freedom Party. After Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president in 2015, Kelly Weill of The Daily Beast wrote that Barr ""veered right"" in her politics. After Roseanne was revived, Trump called her to congratulate her on her show's ratings and thank her for her support. She has frequently defended her support of Trump, and has been criticized for her personal attacks, conspiracy theories, and promotion of fake news.Roseanne was revived in 2018 on ABC. A ratings success, it was renewed for an additional season, but was canceled after Barr made a controversial tweet condemned as racist by many commentators.

The specific charges against Clinton were lying under oath and obstruction of justice. The charges stemmed from a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by Paula Jones and from Clinton's testimony denying that he had engaged in a sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The catalyst for the president's impeachment was the Starr Report, a September 1998 report prepared by Independent Counsel Ken Starr for the House Judiciary Committee.On December 19, 1998, Clinton became the second American president to be impeached (the first being Andrew Johnson, who was impeached in 1868), when the House formally adopted two articles of impeachment and forwarded them to the United States Senate for adjudication; two other articles were considered, but were rejected. A trial in the Senate began in January 1999, with Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding. On February 12, Clinton was acquitted on both counts as neither received the necessary two-thirds majority vote of the senators present for conviction and removal from office—in this instance 67.

769,1999,February,12,US President Bill Clinton acquitted by the Senate in his impeachment trial,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton,"The impeachment of Bill Clinton was initiated on October 8, 1998, when the United States House of Representatives voted to commence impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the United States, for ""high crimes and misdemeanors"". The specific charges against Clinton were lying under oath and obstruction of justice. The charges stemmed from a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by Paula Jones and from Clinton's testimony denying that he had engaged in a sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The catalyst for the president's impeachment was the Starr Report, a September 1998 report prepared by Independent Counsel Ken Starr for the House Judiciary Committee.On December 19, 1998, Clinton became the second American president to be impeached (the first being Andrew Johnson, who was impeached in 1868), when the House formally adopted two articles of impeachment and forwarded them to the United States Senate for adjudication; two other articles were considered, but were rejected. A trial in the Senate began in January 1999, with Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding. On February 12, Clinton was acquitted on both counts as neither received the necessary two-thirds majority vote of the senators present for conviction and removal from office—in this instance 67. On Article One, 45 senators voted to convict while 55 voted for acquittal. On Article Two, 50 senators voted to convict while 50 voted for acquittal.

Grenada consists of the island of Grenada itself plus six smaller islands which lie to the north of the main island. It is located northwest of Trinidad and Tobago, northeast of Venezuela and southwest of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Its size is 348.5 square kilometres (134.6 sq mi), and it had an estimated population of 112,200 in July 2018. Its capital is St. George's. Grenada is also known as the ""Island of Spice"" due to its production of nutmeg and mace crops. The national bird of Grenada is the critically endangered Grenada dove.

Before the arrival of Europeans in the Americas, Grenada was inhabited by the indigenous Arawaks and later by the Island Caribs. Christopher Columbus sighted Grenada in 1498 during his third voyage to the Americas. Although it was deemed the property of the King of Spain, there are no records to suggest the Spanish ever landed or settled on the island. Following several unsuccessful attempts by Europeans to colonise the island due to resistance from the Island Caribs, French settlement and colonisation began in 1650 and continued for the next century. On 10 February 1763, Grenada was ceded to the British under the Treaty of Paris. British rule continued until 1974 (except for a period of French rule between 1779 and 1783). From 1958 to 1962 Grenada was part of the Federation of the West Indies, a short-lived federation of British West Indian colonies. On 3 March 1967, Grenada was granted full autonomy over its internal affairs as an associated state.
Independence as a sovereign state was granted on 7 February 1974, without breaking formal ties with the Commonwealth, under the leadership of Eric Gairy, who became the first Prime Minister of Grenada, with Queen Elizabeth as Head of State. In March 1979, the Marxist–Leninist New Jewel Movement overthrew Gairy's government in a popular bloodless coup d'état and established the People's Revolutionary Government (PRG), headed by Maurice Bishop as Prime Minister. Bishop was later executed by military hardliners, prompting a U.S.-led invasion in October 1983. Since then democratic governance has been restored and the island has remained politically stable.","{2861, 4741}",2,"['The World Trade Organisation', 'the United States', 'the European Union', 'Grenada', 'the West Indies', 'the Caribbean Sea', 'Grenadines', 'Grenada', 'Grenada', 'Trinidad', 'Tobago', 'Venezuela', 'Saint Vincent', 'Grenadines', 'July 2018', ""St. George's"", 'Grenada', 'the ""Island of Spice', 'Grenada', 'Grenada', 'Europeans', 'Americas', 'Grenada', 'Arawaks', 'the Island Caribs', 'Christopher Columbus', 'Grenada', '1498', 'Americas', 'the King of Spain', 'Spanish', 'Europeans', 'the Island Caribs', 'French', '1650', 'the next century', '10 February 1763', 'Grenada', 'British', 'the Treaty of Paris', 'British', '1974', 'French', 'between 1779 and 1783', '1958 to 1962', 'Grenada', 'the Federation of the West Indies', 'British', 'West Indian', '3 March 1967', 'Grenada', '7 February 1974', 'Commonwealth', 'Eric Gairy', 'Grenada', 'Queen Elizabeth', 'State', 'March 1979', 'Marxist', 'Leninist New Jewel Movement', 'Gairy', ""the People's Revolutionary Government"", 'PRG', 'Maurice Bishop', 'Bishop', 'October 1983']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'PRODUCT', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LAW', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"
772,1999,April,20,"Columbine High School massacre: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold kill 13 people and injure 24 others before committing suicide at Columbine High School, Colorado",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Harris_and_Dylan_Klebold,"Eric David Harris (April 9, 1981 – April 20, 1999) and Dylan Bennet Klebold (; September 11, 1981 – April 20, 1999) were an American mass murder duo who killed 13 people and wounded 24 others on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School in Columbine, Colorado. Harris and Klebold simultaneously committed suicide in the library, where they had killed ten of their victims. This became known as the Columbine High School massacre. Harris and Klebold were seniors at the school, making the attack just weeks before the pair were due to graduate. The Napa Valley Register has called them ""cultural icons"" for disenfranchised youth. Harris and Klebold's shooting spree still remains one of the most infamous shootings in history. The shooting would also go on to cause a massive moral panic in society, leading more schools to implement zero tolerance policies.
Harris and Klebold were both born in 1981. While Klebold stayed situated all of his life in Colorado, Harris moved around frequently due to his father being a U.S. Air Force transport pilot. Harris finally settled in Littleton, Colorado, in 1993, when his father was forced to retire. Harris and Klebold had met sometime while they were in the 7th grade at Ken Caryl Middle School. Over time, they became increasingly close. By the time they were juniors, they were described as inseparable. There are differing reports: some say Harris and Klebold were very unpopular students and frequent targets of bullying, while others say they weren't near the bottom of the school's social hierarchy and each had many friends. The pair were known to have near opposite personalities. Harris was described by his peers as more outgoing and charismatic, while Klebold was known to be more quiet and shy. They were both arrested in January 1998 for breaking into a van and stealing equipment. They got into a diversionary program, to help the boys stay out of any more trouble by going to frequent meetings with their psychiatrists and doing community service, while expunging their criminal records if they passed, which they successfully did at the beginning of 1999. From their journal entries, Harris and Klebold had seemed to begin planning the attack by May 1998. Throughout the next year, Harris and Klebold meticulously built explosives and gathered an arsenal of weapons. The pair left behind many journal writings and home videos, foreshadowing the massacre and explaining their actions, with what they hoped to achieve. They would often cite the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing as an inspiration and as a goal to surpass the bombing's casualties.
After the massacre, it was widely believed Harris and Klebold were part of a clique in school called the ""Trenchcoat Mafia"", a group of misfits in the school who supposedly rebelled against the jocks. This turned out to be untrue, as neither Harris nor Klebold had any affiliation with the group. Others attributed bullying, mental illness or poor parenting to the attack. The answer proved not to be simple to investigators, but the pair's journals and recordings gave insight into Harris and Klebold's mindsets. The FBI concluded that Harris was a brooding psychopath, who showed in his journal writings a lack of empathy, narcissism and unconstrained aggression. Klebold, however, was concluded as an angry depressive. Klebold showed in his journal writings great agony and feeling of no self-worth, who wanted to get revenge on those who did him wrong. Since neither Harris or Klebold were diagnosed with any mental disorders prior to the attack, it is unclear if they suffered from any mental illness. Klebold's mother believes the pair had a ""magnetic attraction"" to one another. The FBI's conclusion is often disputed, such as people arguing Harris was also depressed because he took the anti-depressant Luvox; and Klebold was the first to mention a killing spree in a 1997 journal entry. The motive for the attack remains inconclusive.
Harris and Klebold have had a significant impact on popular culture, with the pair often seen, depicted and referenced through movies, television shows, video games, music, stage plays, documentaries and books. Many killers since the Columbine massacre have taken inspiration from the two, hailing them as heroes, icons and martyrs. Harris and Klebold also have a fanbase who call themselves ""Columbiners"", who make blog posts, fan fiction and fan art on them. Others have also dressed as Harris and Klebold for Halloween or cosplay.","{4097, 4611, 2051, 7, 2568, 1566, 1058, 2082, 38, 1576, 4661, 4671, 4682, 2636, 595, 1622, 2141, 2152, 1649, 3702, 128, 640, 3727, 1177, 666, 4768, 2210, 3234, 3243, 1709, 1711, 4785, 2240, 3777, 3795, 4307, 4829, 748, 3308, 1272, 3322, 3842, 1795, 4895, 1319, 4905, 1834, 304, 4400, 4920, 826, 3908, 325, 2388, 3413, 4437, 1374, 4971, 889, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 387, 3459, 903, 3979, 1938, 3989, 1432, 3999, 5033, 4526, 2483, 1979, 4539, 4545, 452, 964, 1990, 967, 3524, 4549, 4558, 5077, 2529, 4589}",87,"['Columbine High School', 'Eric Harris', 'Dylan Klebold', 'Columbine High School', 'Colorado', 'Eric David Harris', 'April 9, 1981', 'April 20, 1999', 'Dylan Bennet Klebold', 'September 11, 1981', 'April 20, 1999', 'American', 'April 20, 1999', 'Columbine High School', 'Columbine', 'Colorado', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'the Columbine High School', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'just weeks', 'The Napa Valley Register', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'Harris', 'Klebold', '1981', 'Klebold', 'Colorado', 'Harris', 'U.S. Air Force', 'Harris', 'Littleton', 'Colorado', '1993', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'Ken Caryl Middle School', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'January 1998', 'the beginning of 1999', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'May 1998', 'the next year', 'Harris', 'Klebold', '1995', 'Oklahoma City Bombing', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'the ""Trenchcoat Mafia""', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'FBI', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'Klebold', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'Klebold', 'FBI', 'Harris', 'Luvox', 'Klebold', '1997', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'Columbine', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'Columbiners', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'Halloween']","['ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"

The tribunal was an ad hoc court located in The Hague, Netherlands.
The Court was established by Resolution 827 of the United Nations Security Council, which was passed on 25 May 1993. It had jurisdiction over four clusters of crimes committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991: grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of war, genocide, and crimes against humanity. The maximum sentence it could impose was life imprisonment. Various countries signed agreements with the UN to carry out custodial sentences.
A total of 161 persons were indicted; the final indictments were issued in December 2004, the last of which were confirmed and unsealed in the spring of 2005. The final fugitive, Goran Hadžić, was arrested on 20 July 2011. The final judgment was issued on 29 November 2017 and the institution formally ceased to exist on 31 December 2017.Residual functions of the ICTY, including oversight of sentences and consideration of any appeal proceedings initiated since 1 July 2013, are under the jurisdiction of a successor body, the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT).","{4605, 4994, 1027, 900, 3332, 1929, 2955, 1036, 3980, 3727, 272, 785, 1170, 278, 2200, 1566, 4895, 1058, 2723, 4516, 805, 3621, 1703, 2216, 3495, 3752, 3882, 4905, 1197, 1584, 4017, 2100, 2104, 825, 3385, 1979, 1084, 4536, 4923, 3903, 703, 575, 1471, 1857, 1731, 452, 580, 964, 2241, 3777, 4287, 4807, 4899, 3322, 463, 208, 1622, 2775, 1244, 889, 1502, 1248, 98, 355, 3301, 3046, 2152, 494, 1137, 1139, 2036, 2297, 3578, 2555, 1017}",75,"['The International Criminal Tribunal', 'Yugoslavia', 'Slobodan Milošević', 'Kosovo', 'The International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law', 'Yugoslavia', '1991', 'the International Criminal Tribunal', 'Yugoslavia', 'the United Nations', 'Yugoslav', 'The Hague', 'Netherlands', 'Resolution 827', 'the United Nations Security Council', '25 May 1993', 'Yugoslavia', '1991', 'the Geneva Conventions', 'UN', 'December 2004', 'the spring of 2005', 'Goran Hadžić', '20 July 2011', 'November 2017', '31 December 2017.Residual', 'ICTY', '1 July 2013', 'the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals', 'IRMCT']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LAW', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG']"

The story revolves around Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), a New Jersey-based Italian-American mobster, portraying the difficulties that he faces as he tries to balance his family life with his role as the leader of a criminal organization. These are explored during his therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco). The series features Tony's family members, mafia colleagues, and rivals in prominent roles—most notably his wife Carmela (Edie Falco) and his protégé/distant cousin Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli).
The pilot was ordered in 1997, and the show premiered on HBO on January 10, 1999. The series ran for six seasons totaling 86 episodes until June 10, 2007. Broadcast syndication followed in the U.S. and internationally. The Sopranos was produced by HBO, Chase Films, and Brad Grey Television. It was primarily filmed at Silvercup Studios in New York City and on location in New Jersey. The executive producers throughout the show's run were David Chase, Brad Grey, Robin Green, Mitchell Burgess, Ilene S. Landress, Terence Winter, and Matthew Weiner.
The Sopranos is widely regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time. The series won a multitude of awards, including Peabody Awards for its first two seasons, 21 Primetime Emmy Awards, and five Golden Globe Awards. It has been the subject of critical analysis, controversy, and parody, and has spawned books, a video game, soundtrack albums, and assorted merchandise.

The group consists of AJ McLean, Howie Dorough, Nick Carter, Kevin Richardson, and Brian Littrell.
The group rose to fame with their debut international album, Backstreet Boys (1996). In the following year, they released their second international album Backstreet's Back (1997) along with their self-titled U.S. debut album, which continued the group's success worldwide. They rose to superstardom with their third studio album Millennium (1999) and its follow-up album, Black & Blue (2000). After a two-year hiatus, they regrouped and released a comeback album Never Gone (2005). After the conclusion of the Never Gone Tour in 2006, Richardson left the group to pursue other interests. The group then released two albums as a quartet: Unbreakable (2007) and This Is Us (2009).
In 2012, the group announced that Richardson had rejoined them permanently. In the following year, they celebrated their 20th anniversary and released their first independent album, In a World Like This (2013). The Backstreet Boys are one of the few boy bands to have continued success long after their peak. Their 2019 album DNA debuted at number one, more than two decades after the group formed, and 19 years after they last topped in 2000. They also became the first boy band to top the U.S. album charts in three different decades.The Backstreet Boys have sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling boy band of all time, and one of the world's best-selling music artists. They are the first group since Led Zeppelin to have their first ten albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, and the only boy band to do so. The group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on April 22, 2013.

The next three-and-a-half years followed with Bocelli holding permanent residency at the No. 1 spot. Six of his albums have since reached the Top 10 on the Billboard 200, and a record-setting 7, have topped the Classical albums charts, in the United States.With 5 million units sold worldwide, Sacred Arias became the biggest-selling classical album by a solo artist of all time, and with just under 20 million units sold worldwide, his 1997 pop album, Romanza, became the best-selling album by an Italian artist ever, as well as the best-selling album by a foreign artist in Canada, and a number of other countries in Europe and Latin America.

His first world title in 1990, at the age of 21, made him the youngest-ever World Champion, a record that he still holds.Hendry also won six Masters titles (including five consecutively), and five UK Championship titles. His total of 18 Triple Crown tournament wins is surpassed only by O'Sullivan's 19. One of only three players to have won all three Triple Crown events in a single season, Hendry is the only player to have achieved the feat twice, in the 1989/1990 and 1995/1996 seasons. He shares the record for the most ranking titles (36) with Ronnie O'Sullivan. A prolific break builder, he recorded a total of 775 career century breaks, and made 11 officially-recognised maximum breaks in professional competition.He was awarded an MBE in 1994, and voted BBC Scotland's Sports Personality of the Year in 1987 and 1996.

Early Tour riders consumed alcohol and used ether, among other substances, as a means of dulling the pain of competing in endurance cycling. Riders began using substances as a means of increasing performance rather than dulling the senses, and organizing bodies such as the Tour and the International Cycling Union (UCI), as well as government bodies, enacted policies to combat the practice.
Use of performance-enhancing drugs in cycling predates the Tour de France. Cycling, having been from the start a sport of extremes, whether of speed by being paced by tandems, motorcycles and even cars, or of distance, the suffering involved encouraged the means to alleviate it. Not until after World War II were sporting or even particularly health issues raised. Those came shortly before the death of Tom Simpson in the Tour de France of 1967. Max Novich referred to the Tour de France in a 1973 issue of New York State Journal of Medicine as ""a cycling nightmare"". Journalist Hans Halter wrote in 1998 that ""For as long as the Tour has existed, since 1903, its participants have been doping themselves. For 60 years doping was allowed. For the past 30 years it has been officially prohibited.

As of 2020 North Korea continues its basic adherence to a centralized command economy. There has been some economic liberalization, particularly after Kim Jong-un assumed the leadership in 2012, but reports conflict over particular legislation and enactment. According to economic freedom ranking by Heritage Foundation, North Korea's economic freedom score is 5.9, making it the least free of the 180 economies measured in the 2019 Index.Due to the hereditary autocracy of the Kim family, the sanctions imposed by the western countries led by the United States, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, etc., and while the current North Korean economy is still dominated by state-owned industry and collective farms, foreign investment and corporate autonomy have been opened to a small extent.
The collapse of the Eastern Bloc from 1989 to 1991, particularly North Korea's principal source of support, the Soviet Union, forced the North Korean economy to realign its foreign economic relations, including increased economic exchanges with South Korea. China is North Korea's largest trading partner. North Korea's ideology of Juche has resulted in the country pursuing autarky in an environment of international sanctions.North Korea had a similar GDP per capita to its neighbor South Korea from the aftermath of the Korean War until the mid-1970s, but had a GDP per capita of less than $2,000 in the late 1990s and early 21st century.","{1985, 2210, 290, 4134, 967, 4426, 2507, 2702, 4430, 4402, 4307, 1949}",12,"['South Korean', 'Kim Dae Jung', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong-il', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong-un', '2012', 'Heritage Foundation', ""North Korea's"", '2019', 'Kim', 'the United States', 'the Soviet Union', 'North Korean', 'the Eastern Bloc', '1989 to 1991', ""North Korea's"", 'the Soviet Union', 'North Korean', 'South Korea', 'China', ""North Korea's"", ""North Korea's"", 'Juche', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'the Korean War', 'the mid-1970s', 'the late 1990s', 'early 21st century']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE']"

Bush and Al Gore is inconclusive; the result, in Bush's favor, is eventually resolved by the Supreme Court",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Counsel_investigation_(2017%E2%80%932019),"The Special Counsel investigation was an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and suspicious links between Trump associates and Russian officials, conducted by special prosecutor Robert Mueller from May 2017 to March 2019. It was also called the Russia investigation, the Mueller probe, and the Mueller investigation. Since July 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had been covertly investigating activities by Russian operatives and by members of the Trump presidential campaign, under the code name ""Crossfire Hurricane"".In May 2017, President Donald Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey, because he was critical of Comey's handling of the Clinton and Russia probes. Within eight days, following a call to action by Democratic lawmakers and revelations by Comey, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, to take over the FBI's work. According to its authorizing document, the investigation's scope included allegations of ""links and/or coordination"" between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Mueller was also mandated to pursue ""any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation."" The probe included a criminal investigation which looked into potential obstruction of justice charges against President Trump and members of his campaign or his administration.The investigation was officially concluded on March 22, 2019, with the Mueller Report submitted to Attorney General William Barr. Barr had been critical of the investigation before he became Attorney General. A redacted version of the report was released to the public on April 18, 2019. The report concluded that the IRA's social media campaign supported Trump's presidential candidacy while attacking Clinton's, and Russian intelligence hacked and released damaging material from the Clinton campaign and various Democratic Party organizations. The investigation ""identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign"", and determined that the Trump campaign ""expected it would benefit electorally"" from Russian hacking efforts. However, ultimately ""the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities"". The evidence was not necessarily complete due to encrypted, deleted, or unsaved communications as well as false, incomplete, or declined testimony. Mueller later said that the investigation's conclusion on Russian interference ""deserves the attention of every American"".On potential obstruction of justice by President Trump, the investigation ""does not conclude that the President committed a crime"", as investigators would not indict a sitting president per an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion, and would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court. However, the investigation ""also does not exonerate"" Trump, finding both public and private actions ""by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations"". Ten episodes of potential obstruction by the president were described. The report states that Congress can decide whether Trump obstructed justice, and has the authority to take action against him. Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who had authorized the Mueller probe, decided on March 24, 2019, that the evidence was insufficient to establish a finding of obstruction of justice. Upon his resignation on May 29, 2019, Mueller stated that: ""the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing"". In July 2019, Mueller testified to Congress that a president could be charged with obstruction of justice (or other crimes) after he left office.","{1026, 7, 2568, 521, 3083, 528, 4113, 3090, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1058, 4134, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4138, 4647, 3630, 1583, 1584, 2104, 1081, 1084, 576, 3139, 580, 583, 1616, 4688, 1622, 2647, 2649, 3163, 2652, 3676, 4192, 1633, 2152, 619, 2155, 3693, 1649, 4722, 2169, 3195, 2171, 640, 1153, 2176, 1162, 3722, 4235, 2703, 144, 3727, 1170, 154, 4768, 2213, 4775, 1192, 4785, 3252, 703, 4287, 2241, 3777, 1732, 3272, 1228, 717, 2764, 3277, 3795, 4307, 3285, 3804, 1757, 3805, 4829, 3808, 2274, 1251, 2278, 3303, 2793, 234, 4330, 2798, 1783, 2297, 3322, 1275, 3842, 771, 1288, 1292, 1808, 4895, 294, 2342, 4905, 4916, 311, 2875, 1341, 4413, 3903, 1857, 843, 2891, 4941, 4942, 2388, 2901, 3927, 4445, 1888, 1386, 4971, 2415, 4472, 889, 4986, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 2955, 3468, 3979, 1424, 401, 1432, 418, 936, 4014, 4024, 1979, 5059, 452, 964, 4549, 5065, 2507, 2508, 1997, 5067, 2004, 5077, 5079, 3544, 3034, 478, 990, 1502, 1508, 2026, 492, 4589, 5107, 2040, 3578, 4605}",166,"['US', 'George W.

794,2000,December,12,"US Supreme Court releases its decision in Bush v. Gore, settling the recount dispute in Florida's 2000 presidential election in George W. Bush's favor and thus handing him the presidency",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter,"James Earl Carter Jr. (born October 1, 1924) is an American politician, philanthropist, and former farmer who served as the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as a Georgia State Senator from 1963 to 1967 and as the 76th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. Since leaving the presidency, Carter has remained active in the private sector; in 2002, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in co-founding the Carter Center.
Raised in Plains, Georgia, Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and joined the United States Navy, where he served on submarines. After the death of his father in 1953, Carter left his naval career and returned home to Georgia to take up the reins of his family's peanut-growing business. Carter inherited comparatively little due to his father's forgiveness of debts and the division of the estate among the children. Nevertheless, his ambition to expand and grow the Carters' peanut business was fulfilled. During this period, Carter was motivated to oppose the political climate of racial segregation and support the growing civil rights movement. He became an activist within the Democratic Party. From 1963 to 1967, Carter served in the Georgia State Senate, and in 1970, he was elected as Governor of Georgia, defeating former Governor Carl Sanders in the Democratic primary on an anti-segregation platform advocating affirmative action for ethnic minorities. Carter remained as governor until 1975. Despite being a dark-horse candidate who was little known outside of Georgia at the start of the campaign, Carter won the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination. In the general election, Carter ran as an outsider and narrowly defeated incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford. 
On his second day in office, Carter pardoned all the Vietnam War draft evaders. During Carter's term as president, two new cabinet-level departments, the Department of Energy and the Department of Education, were established. He established a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II), and the return of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. On the economic front, he confronted persistent stagflation, a combination of high inflation, high unemployment and slow growth. The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979–1981 Iran hostage crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the Cold War when he ended détente, imposed a grain embargo against the Soviets, enunciated the Carter Doctrine, and led a 1980 Summer Olympics boycott in Moscow. In 1980, Carter faced a challenge from Senator Ted Kennedy in the primaries, but he won re-nomination at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. Carter lost the general election to Republican nominee Ronald Reagan in an electoral landslide. Polls of historians and political scientists usually rank Carter as an average president; he often receives more positive evaluations for his post-presidential work.
In 1982, Carter established the Carter Center to promote and expand human rights. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and advance disease prevention and eradication in developing nations. Carter is considered a key figure in the Habitat for Humanity charity. He has written over 30 books ranging from political memoirs to poetry while continuing to actively comment on ongoing American and global affairs, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The earliest-serving of the five living U.S. presidents, Carter is the longest-lived president, the longest-retired president, the first to live forty years after their inauguration, and the first to reach the age of 95.",set(),0,"['US Supreme Court', 'Bush', 'Gore', 'Florida', '2000', ""George W.

Founded in 1860, it was originally held annually at Prestwick Golf Club, Scotland, before evolving to being rotated between a select group of coastal links golf courses in the United Kingdom, under the authority of The R&A.
The Open is one of the four major golf tournaments, the others being the Masters Tournament, the PGA Championship and the U.S. Open. Since the PGA Championship moved to May in 2019, the Open has been chronologically the fourth and final major tournament of the year. The tournament traditionally takes place over four days in summer, starting the day before the third Friday in July.
It is called the Open, because it is in theory ""open"" to all, i.e. professional and amateur golfers. In practice, the current event is a professional tournament in which a small number of the world's leading amateurs also play, by invitation or qualification. The success of the tournament has led to many other open golf tournaments to be introduced around the world.
The current champion is Shane Lowry, who won the 148th Open at Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland with a score of 269. It was also held at Portrush in 1951, the first occasion that it had not been held in Scotland or England.","{2057, 1547, 524, 2587, 2076, 1566, 2079, 2080, 35, 550, 3110, 42, 1579, 4138, 560, 4661, 58, 2118, 4174, 2140, 1629, 606, 3678, 1633, 1634, 613, 617, 110, 3186, 1142, 2171, 1659, 128, 640, 1153, 4736, 3205, 646, 1676, 3213, 3727, 145, 1683, 661, 1688, 1695, 3743, 4768, 2210, 4770, 1190, 1193, 3243, 3252, 4287, 3777, 1730, 3268, 3272, 1738, 3795, 212, 2261, 1238, 2264, 1757, 3295, 1251, 1253, 2278, 2789, 2793, 748, 3309, 4845, 1265, 755, 757, 1273, 762, 3322, 3324, 765, 3834, 260, 776, 265, 1288, 1803, 1295, 4372, 278, 793, 795, 1309, 3359, 4895, 3874, 4899, 3365, 2342, 2855, 2856, 4905, 810, 3882, 2862, 3382, 2362, 2875, 4924, 3901, 2368, 2369, 327, 1867, 2891, 1873, 2901, 3413, 4950, 1880, 2910, 2400, 2913, 355, 3431, 363, 4971, 2415, 2929, 2420, 1398, 889, 1409, 1929, 394, 3979, 5003, 1424, 1938, 2962, 4498, 406, 3481, 4516, 421, 1960, 4526, 2483, 1979, 3516, 5051, 3524, 453, 4549, 1479, 971, 2507, 5070, 464, 3025, 1490, 5077, 3542, 472, 2525, 1508, 998, 999, 2026, 1008, 501, 1526}",174,"['Tiger Woods', 'Ben Hogan', '1953', 'a calendar year', 'Bob May', 'British', '1860', 'annually', 'Prestwick Golf Club', 'Scotland', 'the United Kingdom', 'the Masters Tournament', 'the PGA Championship', 'the U.S. Open', 'May in 2019', 'Open', 'the year', 'four days', 'summer', 'the day before the third Friday in July', 'Open', 'Shane Lowry', 'the 148th Open', 'Royal Portrush Golf Club', 'Northern Ireland', 'Portrush', '1951', 'Scotland', 'England']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE']"

He is a co-founder of the online non-profit encyclopedia Wikipedia and the for-profit web hosting company Wikia.Wales was born in Huntsville, Alabama, where he attended Randolph School, a university-preparatory school. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees in finance from Auburn University and the University of Alabama respectively. In graduate school, Wales taught at two universities; however, he departed before completing a PhD to take a job in finance and later worked as the research director of a Chicago futures and options firm. 
In 1996, he and two partners founded Bomis, a web portal featuring entertainment and adult content. Bomis  provided the initial funding for the free peer-reviewed encyclopedia, Nupedia (2000–2003), and its successor, Wikipedia. On January 15, 2001, with Larry Sanger and others, Wales launched Wikipedia—a free, open-content encyclopedia that enjoyed rapid growth and popularity. As Wikipedia's public profile grew, he became its promoter and spokesman. Though he is historically credited as co-founder, he has disputed this, declaring himself the sole founder.Wales serves on the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, the charity that he helped establish to operate Wikipedia, holding its board-appointed ""community founder"" seat. For his role in creating Wikipedia, which has become the world's largest encyclopedia, in 2006 Time named him one of ""The 100 Most Influential People in the World"".","{4611, 7, 2568, 524, 2066, 28, 1566, 1058, 1576, 4140, 1584, 2104, 4671, 1602, 580, 593, 1622, 4192, 2152, 1133, 1649, 2171, 640, 2703, 144, 3727, 1170, 4768, 4770, 682, 173, 174, 1197, 1711, 4785, 690, 3777, 1739, 3795, 4307, 4829, 748, 1272, 3322, 1275, 3842, 771, 1795, 3346, 4895, 3874, 805, 1319, 4905, 4400, 4920, 826, 2388, 4437, 3927, 1888, 874, 4971, 4980, 889, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 3459, 2955, 3980, 5010, 3989, 1432, 3483, 5033, 2475, 3500, 434, 3508, 2489, 1979, 961, 452, 964, 4558, 467, 5077, 1502, 2537, 4589, 3578, 2555, 4605}",95,"['Jimmy Wales', 'Larry Sanger', 'Jimmy Donal ""Jimbo"" Wales', 'August 7, 1966', 'American', 'Wikipedia', 'Wikia', 'Wales', 'Huntsville', 'Alabama', 'Randolph School', 'Auburn University', 'the University of Alabama', 'Wales', 'PhD', 'Chicago', '1996', 'Bomis', 'Bomis', 'Nupedia', 'Wikipedia', 'January 15, 2001', 'Larry Sanger', 'Wales', 'Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia', 'the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees', 'Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia', '2006', 'Time']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG']"

The mission succeeded in closing in with the asteroid and orbited it several times, finally terminating by touching down on the asteroid on 12 February 2001.
The primary scientific objective of NEAR was to return data on the bulk properties, composition, mineralogy, morphology, internal mass distribution and magnetic field of Eros. Secondary objectives include studies of regolith properties, interactions with the solar wind, possible current activity as indicated by dust or gas, and the asteroid spin state. This data will be used to help understand the characteristics of asteroids in general, their relationship to meteoroids and comets, and the conditions in the early Solar System. To accomplish these goals, the spacecraft was equipped with an X-ray/gamma-ray spectrometer, a near-infrared imaging spectrograph, a multi-spectral camera fitted with a CCD imaging detector, a laser rangefinder, and a magnetometer. A radio science experiment was also performed using the NEAR tracking system to estimate the gravity field of the asteroid. The total mass of the instruments was 56 kg, and they required 80 W power.","{640, 1025, 3842, 4993, 1668, 4994, 7, 1802, 2955, 2703, 3727, 3989, 3864, 1821, 1566, 4895, 4768, 290, 1058, 2210, 4134, 4905, 2171, 4785, 442, 1979, 2875, 4539, 1343, 704, 3777, 4547, 964, 2884, 4549, 967, 3528, 2122, 971, 2507, 2763, 4682, 4815, 3322, 2514, 4307, 595, 2388, 2261, 1622, 2645, 3154, 3795, 603, 3036, 4829, 5077, 889, 743, 2152, 4971, 620, 3180, 4589, 4477, 375, 2169, 4474, 3451, 4605, 2558}",71,"['Eros', 'The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous', '1996', 'Eugene Shoemaker', 'the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory', 'NASA', 'Earth', 'Eros', '12 February 2001', 'NEAR', 'Eros', 'NEAR']","['ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP']"

One World Trade Center (WTC 1) the ""North Tower"" was hit at 8:46 a.m. Eastern time and collapsed at 10:28 a.m. Two World Trade Center (WTC 2) the ""South Tower"" was hit at 9:02 a.m. and collapsed at 9:59 a.m. The resulting debris severely damaged or destroyed more than a dozen other adjacent and nearby structures, ultimately leading to the collapse of Seven World Trade Center at 5:21 p.m.
A total of 2,763 people were killed in the collapses, including 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers as well as all the passengers and crew on the airplanes, which included 147 civilians and the ten hijackers.
In September 2005, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published the results of its investigation into the collapse. The investigators did not find anything substandard in the design of the twin towers, noting that the severity of the attacks was beyond anything experienced in buildings in the past. They determined the fires to be the main cause of the collapses, finding that sagging floors pulled inward on the perimeter columns, causing them to bow and then to buckle. Once the upper section of the building began to move downwards, a total progressive collapse was unavoidable.
The cleanup of the World Trade Center site involved round-the-clock operations and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  Some surrounding structures that were not hit by the airplanes still sustained significant damage, requiring them to be torn down. Demolition of the surrounding damaged buildings continued even as new construction proceeded on the Twin Towers' replacement, the new One World Trade Center, which was opened in November 2014.","{128, 1025, 4736, 2702, 4642, 4134, 1985, 967, 4426, 2507, 4815, 4688, 595, 467, 2529, 1640, 3180, 625, 1395, 1780}",20,"['Al Qaeda', ""New York's"", 'World Trade Towers', 'World Trade Center', 'Manhattan', 'New York City', 'September 11, 2001', 'Eastern', 'Seven World Trade Center', 'September 2005', 'the National Institute of Standards and Technology', 'the World Trade Center', ""the Twin Towers'"", 'November 2014']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE']"

The immediate deaths included 265 on the four planes (including the terrorists), 2,606 in the World Trade Center and in the surrounding area, and 125 at the Pentagon. The attacks were the deadliest terrorist act in world history, and the most devastating foreign attack on United States soil since the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.Most of those who perished were civilians except for 343 firefighters and 71 law enforcement officers who died in the World Trade Center and on the ground in New York City, and another law enforcement officer who died when United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, 55 military personnel who died at the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, and the 19 terrorists who died on board the four aircraft. Overall, 2,605 U.S. citizens, including 2,135 civilians, died in the attacks, while an additional 372 non-U.S. citizens (excluding the 19 perpetrators) also perished, which represented about 12% of the total. More than 90 countries lost citizens in the attacks, including the United Kingdom (67 deaths), the Dominican Republic (47 deaths), and India (41 deaths).
2,974 victims were confirmed to have died in the initial attacks. In 2007, the New York City medical examiner's office began to add people who died of illnesses caused by exposure to dust from the site to the official death toll. The first such victim was a woman, a civil rights lawyer, who had died from a chronic lung condition in February 2002. In September 2009, the office added a man who died in October 2008, and in 2011, a male accountant who had died in December 2010. This raises the number of victims at the World Trade Center site to 2,753, and the overall 9/11 death toll to 2,996.As of August 2013, medical authorities concluded that 1,140 people who worked, lived, or studied in Lower Manhattan at the time of the attack have been diagnosed with cancer as a result of ""exposure to toxins at Ground Zero"". It has been reported that over 1,400 9/11 rescue workers who responded to the scene in the days and months after the attacks have since died. At least 11 pregnancies were lost as a result of 9/11. Neither the FBI or New York City officially recorded the casualties of the 9/11 attacks in their crime statistics for 2001, with the FBI stating in a disclaimer that ""the number of deaths is so great that combining it with the traditional crime statistics will have an outlier effect that falsely skews all types of measurements in the program's analyses.""","{1539, 2564, 2053, 1029, 7, 3587, 4100, 523, 1555, 3091, 2587, 2079, 1058, 4642, 3109, 550, 3116, 4140, 1584, 565, 1590, 1591, 2104, 1595, 4671, 576, 3648, 4675, 4682, 1613, 3151, 4688, 595, 1109, 1622, 2647, 606, 3678, 608, 1633, 4704, 3686, 2152, 1649, 3699, 3190, 3702, 3192, 2169, 2171, 640, 1153, 4224, 4736, 1668, 1162, 3722, 3727, 144, 3217, 4756, 3734, 1688, 4768, 2210, 680, 1192, 2729, 4268, 3777, 1730, 1732, 4293, 3272, 1228, 2767, 1235, 3795, 4307, 4824, 4825, 1757, 4320, 1251, 3814, 2793, 234, 3307, 748, 4330, 1780, 757, 3322, 1789, 255, 3842, 1795, 3332, 1288, 1802, 1294, 4879, 4372, 794, 4895, 2336, 4905, 3371, 3886, 310, 311, 4923, 1857, 1350, 4426, 843, 1867, 2891, 4940, 849, 2388, 2901, 854, 3927, 4445, 3427, 3431, 4971, 1388, 2924, 2415, 374, 4472, 889, 890, 3451, 1404, 4990, 4993, 3970, 4994, 900, 1924, 903, 4489, 2443, 2955, 3979, 5003, 1424, 2962, 2964, 3482, 2982, 3500, 948, 2487, 4536, 4539, 3008, 1985, 452, 964, 2503, 1483, 5067, 1997, 4561, 2004, 5077, 987, 2529, 1508, 998, 3046, 3560, 2026, 4589, 3572, 1526, 3578, 4605}",182,"['Pentagon', 'September 11', '2001', 'the World Trade Center', 'Pentagon', 'United States', 'Pearl Harbor', 'December 7', 'the World Trade Center', 'New York City', 'United Airlines', 'Flight 93', 'Shanksville', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pentagon', 'Arlington County', 'Virginia', 'U.S.', 'non-U.S.', 'about 12%', 'the United Kingdom', 'the Dominican Republic', 'India', '2007', 'New York City', 'February 2002', 'September 2009', 'October 2008', '2011', 'December 2010', 'the World Trade Center', 'August 2013', 'Manhattan', 'Ground Zero', 'the days', 'months', 'FBI', 'New York City', '2001', 'FBI']","['ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERCENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG']"

815,2001,October,7,The U.S. invasion of Afghanistan starts with an air assault and covert operations on the ground,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Afghanistan,"The United States invasion of Afghanistan occurred after the September 11 attacks in late 2001 and was supported by close US allies. The conflict is also known as the US war in Afghanistan. Its public aims were to dismantle al-Qaeda and deny it a safe base of operations in Afghanistan by removing the Taliban from power. The United Kingdom was a key ally of the United States, offering support for military action from the start of preparations for the invasion. It followed the Afghan Civil War's 1996–2001 phase between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance groups, although the Taliban controlled 90% of the country by 2001. The US invasion of Afghanistan became the first phase of the War in Afghanistan (2001–present).
US President George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda; bin Laden had already been wanted by the FBI since 1998. The Taliban declined to extradite him unless given what they deemed convincing evidence of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks, and ignored demands to shut down terrorist bases and hand over other terrorist suspects apart from bin Laden. The request was dismissed by the US as a meaningless delaying tactic, and it launched Operation Enduring Freedom on October 7, 2001 with the United Kingdom. The two were later joined by other forces, including the Northern Alliance troops on the ground. The US and its allies rapidly drove the Taliban from power by December 17, 2001, and built military bases near major cities across the country. Most al-Qaeda and Taliban members were not captured, escaping to neighboring Pakistan or retreating to rural or remote mountainous regions during the Battle of Tora Bora.In December 2001, the United Nations Security Council established the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to oversee military operations in the country and train Afghan National Security Forces. At the Bonn Conference in December 2001, Hamid Karzai was selected to head the Afghan Interim Administration, which after a 2002 loya jirga (grand assembly) in Kabul became the Afghan Transitional Administration. In the popular elections of 2004, Karzai was elected president of the country, now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. In August 2003, NATO became involved as an alliance, taking the helm of ISAF. One portion of US forces in Afghanistan operated under NATO command; the rest remained under direct US command. Taliban leader Mullah Omar reorganized the movement, and in 2002, it launched an insurgency against the government and ISAF that continues to this day.","{4097, 2052, 7, 2568, 521, 3083, 3090, 3093, 1562, 2078, 1058, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 3630, 1584, 2104, 1081, 576, 3139, 580, 1622, 2647, 2649, 3676, 4192, 1121, 1633, 2152, 3693, 3702, 2682, 3195, 2170, 2171, 130, 144, 663, 666, 154, 159, 4768, 2213, 1192, 2743, 2241, 3777, 1228, 717, 4307, 727, 3804, 3805, 3808, 1251, 3303, 2793, 4330, 4852, 3322, 1275, 3842, 771, 1292, 1808, 4895, 4916, 309, 2869, 311, 4920, 1341, 3903, 1857, 3907, 843, 4941, 4942, 2388, 2901, 1888, 355, 1386, 4971, 367, 4472, 889, 890, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 3460, 903, 2955, 3979, 5003, 3476, 3989, 2487, 4536, 1979, 3005, 5059, 452, 964, 5065, 5067, 2508, 1997, 4563, 5077, 5079, 3034, 478, 1502, 3046, 3047, 2026, 492, 4589, 3054, 5107, 1526, 3578, 2555, 4605}",128,"['U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'United States', 'Afghanistan', 'September 11', 'late 2001', 'US', 'US', 'Afghanistan', 'al-Qaeda', 'Afghanistan', 'Taliban', 'The United Kingdom', 'the United States', ""the Afghan Civil War's"", 'Taliban', 'Northern Alliance', 'Taliban', '90%', '2001', 'US', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'US', 'George W.

816,2001,October,8,US President George W. Bush announces the establishment of the Office of Homeland Security,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush,"The presidency of George W. Bush began at noon EST on January 20, 2001, when George W. Bush was inaugurated as the 43rd president of the United States, and ended on January 20, 2009. Bush, a Republican, took office following a very close victory over Democratic incumbent vice president Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election. Four years later, in the 2004 election, he defeated Democrat John Kerry to win re-election. Bush, the 43rd president, is the eldest son of the 41st president, George H. W. Bush. He was succeeded by Democrat Barack Obama, who won the 2008 presidential election.
Upon taking office, Bush pushed through a $1.3 trillion tax cut program and the No Child Left Behind Act, a major education bill. He also pushed for socially conservative efforts, such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and faith-based welfare initiatives. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Bush declared a global war on terrorism and, in October 2001, ordered an invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, destroy the terrorist group al-Qaeda, and capture Osama bin Laden. That same month, he signed into law the controversial Patriot Act in order to authorize surveillance of suspected terrorists. In 2003, Bush ordered an invasion of Iraq, asserting that Iraq possessed stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1441. Later that year, he signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, which created Medicare Part D.
During his second term, Bush reached multiple free trade agreements and successfully nominated John G. Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. He sought major changes to Social Security and immigration laws, but both efforts failed. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continued, and in 2007 he launched a surge of troops in Iraq. The Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina and the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy earned wide coverage, and his second term saw a drop in his approval ratings. A global meltdown in financial markets dominated his last days in office as policymakers looked to avert a major economic disaster, and he established the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to buy toxic assets from financial institutions.","{1025, 1026, 2051, 7, 2568, 521, 528, 4113, 3090, 1562, 2589, 3110, 4134, 1576, 4647, 1583, 2096, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4688, 595, 1622, 2649, 2141, 606, 1633, 2155, 3180, 1646, 1136, 1649, 1653, 3702, 2169, 3195, 2171, 127, 128, 640, 1153, 131, 2176, 1162, 4235, 1678, 2703, 3727, 4758, 1177, 157, 4768, 2210, 2213, 680, 3252, 3272, 1739, 1228, 717, 2764, 3277, 4815, 1233, 3795, 4307, 4824, 4313, 3803, 3804, 3805, 3808, 1251, 3812, 2278, 3303, 2793, 234, 2794, 2798, 1783, 3322, 1275, 4859, 1288, 1808, 3862, 3869, 290, 807, 1319, 4905, 4916, 311, 2875, 4413, 4430, 2901, 1888, 1890, 873, 874, 1388, 2415, 4474, 3451, 892, 4990, 3970, 387, 3460, 903, 4487, 1424, 401, 1938, 1432, 418, 4014, 2483, 2995, 5049, 1979, 4539, 5059, 3524, 453, 4549, 967, 5065, 971, 2507, 1997, 2508, 3034, 3040, 2529, 1508, 2026, 492, 5106, 1526, 2039, 2040, 3581}",145,"['US', 'George W.

817,2001,October,23,The Provisional Irish Republican Army of Northern Ireland commences disarmament after peace talks,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army,"The Irish Republican Army (IRA; Irish: Óglaigh na hÉireann), also known as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provisional IRA or Provos), was an Irish republican paramilitary organisation that sought to end British rule in Northern Ireland, facilitate Irish reunification and bring about an independent republic encompassing all of Ireland. It was the most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles. It saw itself as the military force of an all-island Irish Republic, and as the sole legitimate successor to the original IRA from the Irish War of Independence. It accordingly referred to itself simply as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), or Óglaigh na hÉireann in Irish. It was designated a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland, both of whose authority it rejected.The Provisional IRA emerged in December 1969, following a split within the previous incarnation of the IRA and the broader Irish republican movement. It was the minority faction in the split, while the majority continued as the Official IRA. The term ""provisional"" was chosen to mirror the 1916 Provisional Government of the Irish Republic, and also to designate it as temporary pending reorganisation of the movement. Although this reorganisation eventually happened in 1970, the name stuck. The Troubles had begun shortly before when a largely Catholic, nonviolent civil rights campaign was met with violence from both Ulster loyalists and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), culminating in the August 1969 riots and deployment of British troops. The IRA initially focused on defence of Catholic areas, but it began an offensive campaign in 1971 (see timeline). The IRA's primary goal was to force the United Kingdom to negotiate a withdrawal from Northern Ireland. It used guerrilla tactics against the British Army and RUC in both rural and urban areas. It also carried out a bombing campaign in Northern Ireland and England against what it saw as political and economic targets.
The Provisional IRA called a final ceasefire in July 1997, after its political wing Sinn Féin was re-admitted into the Northern Ireland peace talks. It supported the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and in 2005 it disarmed under international supervision. An internal British Army document (released in 2007 under the Freedom of Information Act) examining its 37 years of deployment in Northern Ireland, described the IRA as ""a professional, dedicated, highly skilled and resilient force"", while loyalist paramilitaries and other republican groups were described as ""little more than a collection of gangsters"". US media usually described the IRA as ""activists"" and ""guerillas"", while the British press widely dubbed them ""terrorists"". Several splinter groups have been formed as a result of splits within the IRA, including the Continuity IRA (which formed in 1986 but did not become active until after the Provisional IRA ceasefire of 1994) and the Real IRA (after the final 1997 ceasefire), both of which are still active in the low-level dissident Irish republican campaign.
The IRA's armed campaign, primarily in Northern Ireland but also in England and mainland Europe, caused the deaths of over 1,700 people. The dead included around 1,000 members of the British security forces, and about 640 civilians. The IRA itself lost 275–300 members and an estimated 10,000 imprisoned at various times over the 30-year period.","{1378, 4741}",2,"['The Provisional Irish Republican Army', 'Northern Ireland', 'The Irish Republican Army', 'Irish', 'hÉireann', 'the Provisional Irish Republican Army', 'Provos', 'Irish', 'republican', 'British', 'Northern Ireland', 'Irish', 'Ireland', 'republican', 'Troubles', 'Irish', 'the Irish War of Independence', 'the Irish Republican Army', 'Óglaigh na hÉireann', 'Irish', 'the United Kingdom', 'the Republic of Ireland', 'The Provisional IRA', 'December 1969', 'IRA', 'Irish', 'republican', 'the Official IRA', '1916', 'Provisional Government of the Irish Republic', '1970', 'Troubles', 'Catholic', 'Ulster', 'the Royal Ulster Constabulary', 'RUC', 'August 1969', 'British', 'IRA', 'Catholic', '1971', 'IRA', 'the United Kingdom', 'Northern Ireland', 'the British Army', 'RUC', 'Northern Ireland', 'England', 'July 1997', 'Sinn Féin', 'Northern Ireland', '1998', 'Good Friday Agreement', '2005', 'British Army', '2007', 'the Freedom of Information Act', '37 years', 'Northern Ireland', 'IRA', 'republican', 'US', 'IRA', 'British', 'IRA', 'the Continuity IRA', '1986', 'IRA', '1994', '1997', 'Irish', 'republican', 'IRA', 'Northern Ireland', 'England', 'Europe', 'British', 'IRA']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PRODUCT', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'ORG']"

Rowling, premieres starring Daniel Radcliffe",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizarding_World,"The Wizarding World (previously known as J. K. Rowling's Wizarding World) is a fantasy media franchise and shared fictional universe centred on a series of films, based on the Harry Potter novel series by J. K. Rowling. The films have been in production since 2000, and in that time ten films have been produced—eight are adaptations of the Harry Potter novels and two are part of the Fantastic Beasts series. The films are owned and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, and three more are in various stages of production. The series has collectively grossed over $9.1 billion at the global box office, making it the third-highest-grossing film franchise of all time (behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Star Wars).
David Heyman and his company Heyday Films have produced every film in the Wizarding World series. Chris Columbus and Mark Radcliffe served as producers on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, David Barron began producing the films with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in 2007 and ending with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 in 2011, and Rowling produced the final two films in the Harry Potter series. Heyman, Rowling, Steve Kloves and Lionel Wigram have produced both films in the Fantastic Beasts series. The films are written and directed by several individuals and feature large, often ensemble, casts. Many of the actors, including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Tom Felton, star in numerous films. Soundtrack albums have been released for each of the films. The franchise also includes a stage production, a digital publication, a video game label and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter–themed areas at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world.
The first film in the Wizarding World was Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001), which was followed by seven Harry Potter sequels, beginning with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets in 2002 and ending with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 in 2011, nearly ten years after the first film's release.

832,2002,March,2,U.S. invasion of Afghanistan: US conventional forces first deployed as part of Operation Anaconda,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Afghanistan,"The United States invasion of Afghanistan occurred after the September 11 attacks in late 2001 and was supported by close US allies. The conflict is also known as the US war in Afghanistan. Its public aims were to dismantle al-Qaeda and deny it a safe base of operations in Afghanistan by removing the Taliban from power. The United Kingdom was a key ally of the United States, offering support for military action from the start of preparations for the invasion. It followed the Afghan Civil War's 1996–2001 phase between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance groups, although the Taliban controlled 90% of the country by 2001. The US invasion of Afghanistan became the first phase of the War in Afghanistan (2001–present).
US President George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda; bin Laden had already been wanted by the FBI since 1998. The Taliban declined to extradite him unless given what they deemed convincing evidence of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks, and ignored demands to shut down terrorist bases and hand over other terrorist suspects apart from bin Laden. The request was dismissed by the US as a meaningless delaying tactic, and it launched Operation Enduring Freedom on October 7, 2001 with the United Kingdom. The two were later joined by other forces, including the Northern Alliance troops on the ground. The US and its allies rapidly drove the Taliban from power by December 17, 2001, and built military bases near major cities across the country. Most al-Qaeda and Taliban members were not captured, escaping to neighboring Pakistan or retreating to rural or remote mountainous regions during the Battle of Tora Bora.In December 2001, the United Nations Security Council established the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to oversee military operations in the country and train Afghan National Security Forces. At the Bonn Conference in December 2001, Hamid Karzai was selected to head the Afghan Interim Administration, which after a 2002 loya jirga (grand assembly) in Kabul became the Afghan Transitional Administration. In the popular elections of 2004, Karzai was elected president of the country, now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. In August 2003, NATO became involved as an alliance, taking the helm of ISAF. One portion of US forces in Afghanistan operated under NATO command; the rest remained under direct US command. Taliban leader Mullah Omar reorganized the movement, and in 2002, it launched an insurgency against the government and ISAF that continues to this day.","{1378, 4741}",2,"['U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'US', 'United States', 'Afghanistan', 'September 11', 'late 2001', 'US', 'US', 'Afghanistan', 'al-Qaeda', 'Afghanistan', 'Taliban', 'The United Kingdom', 'the United States', ""the Afghan Civil War's"", 'Taliban', 'Northern Alliance', 'Taliban', '90%', '2001', 'US', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'US', 'George W.

833,2002,May,12,"Former US President Jimmy Carter arrives in Cuba for a five-day visit with Fidel Castro becoming first President of the United States, in or out of office, to visit the island since Castro's 1959 revolution.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter,"James Earl Carter Jr. (born October 1, 1924) is an American politician, philanthropist, and former farmer who served as the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as a Georgia State Senator from 1963 to 1967 and as the 76th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. Since leaving the presidency, Carter has remained active in the private sector; in 2002, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in co-founding the Carter Center.
Raised in Plains, Georgia, Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and joined the United States Navy, where he served on submarines. After the death of his father in 1953, Carter left his naval career and returned home to Georgia to take up the reins of his family's peanut-growing business. Carter inherited comparatively little due to his father's forgiveness of debts and the division of the estate among the children. Nevertheless, his ambition to expand and grow the Carters' peanut business was fulfilled. During this period, Carter was motivated to oppose the political climate of racial segregation and support the growing civil rights movement. He became an activist within the Democratic Party. From 1963 to 1967, Carter served in the Georgia State Senate, and in 1970, he was elected as Governor of Georgia, defeating former Governor Carl Sanders in the Democratic primary on an anti-segregation platform advocating affirmative action for ethnic minorities. Carter remained as governor until 1975. Despite being a dark-horse candidate who was little known outside of Georgia at the start of the campaign, Carter won the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination. In the general election, Carter ran as an outsider and narrowly defeated incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford. 
On his second day in office, Carter pardoned all the Vietnam War draft evaders. During Carter's term as president, two new cabinet-level departments, the Department of Energy and the Department of Education, were established. He established a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II), and the return of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. On the economic front, he confronted persistent stagflation, a combination of high inflation, high unemployment and slow growth. The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979–1981 Iran hostage crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the Cold War when he ended détente, imposed a grain embargo against the Soviets, enunciated the Carter Doctrine, and led a 1980 Summer Olympics boycott in Moscow. In 1980, Carter faced a challenge from Senator Ted Kennedy in the primaries, but he won re-nomination at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. Carter lost the general election to Republican nominee Ronald Reagan in an electoral landslide. Polls of historians and political scientists usually rank Carter as an average president; he often receives more positive evaluations for his post-presidential work.
In 1982, Carter established the Carter Center to promote and expand human rights. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and advance disease prevention and eradication in developing nations. Carter is considered a key figure in the Habitat for Humanity charity. He has written over 30 books ranging from political memoirs to poetry while continuing to actively comment on ongoing American and global affairs, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The earliest-serving of the five living U.S. presidents, Carter is the longest-lived president, the longest-retired president, the first to live forty years after their inauguration, and the first to reach the age of 95.","{2051, 4101, 7, 521, 536, 2078, 1058, 2601, 1583, 4671, 1095, 4682, 4688, 595, 1622, 3163, 2141, 1642, 619, 3693, 1136, 1649, 2169, 2170, 2682, 127, 640, 1162, 4758, 4768, 1706, 173, 174, 1709, 703, 2764, 717, 3795, 4307, 3285, 3803, 3805, 3808, 4832, 3812, 4330, 748, 3322, 4859, 1275, 3842, 1795, 1292, 1808, 3862, 4889, 2332, 4895, 3874, 294, 807, 4916, 309, 311, 4920, 4937, 4942, 2388, 4445, 1888, 1386, 4971, 1388, 2415, 3951, 370, 882, 4981, 4983, 4472, 889, 3451, 4993, 3970, 387, 3459, 4994, 4489, 2955, 3979, 4498, 3989, 5019, 2982, 936, 2475, 1454, 4020, 4024, 4536, 4539, 5054, 961, 3524, 965, 1990, 967, 5065, 5067, 2508, 1997, 5074, 4051, 2004, 5077, 5079, 987, 1502, 3040, 997, 4589, 5106, 5107, 3061, 1526, 4605}",126,"['US', 'Jimmy Carter', 'Cuba', 'five-day', 'Fidel Castro', 'the United States', 'Castro', '1959', 'James Earl Carter Jr.', 'October 1, 1924', 'American', 'the United States', '1977 to 1981', 'the Democratic Party', 'Georgia', '1963', '1967', 'Georgia', '1971 to 1975', 'Carter', '2002', 'the Nobel Peace Prize', 'the Carter Center', 'Plains', 'Georgia', 'Carter', 'the United States Naval Academy', '1946', 'Bachelor of Science', 'the United States Navy', '1953', 'Carter', 'Georgia', 'Carter', 'Carters', 'Carter', 'the Democratic Party', 'From 1963 to 1967', 'Carter', '1970', 'Georgia', 'Carl Sanders', 'Democratic', 'Carter', '1975', 'Georgia', 'Carter', '1976', 'Democratic', 'Carter', 'Republican', 'Gerald Ford', 'his second day', 'Carter', 'the Vietnam War', 'Carter', 'the Department of Energy', 'the Department of Education', 'Carter', 'the Camp David Accords', 'the Panama Canal Treaties', 'the Panama Canal Zone', 'Panama', 'Iran', '1979', 'Soviet', 'Afghanistan', 'Carter', 'the Cold War', 'Soviets', '1980', 'Summer Olympics', 'Moscow', '1980', 'Carter', 'Ted Kennedy', '1980', 'Democratic National Convention', 'Carter', 'Republican', 'Ronald Reagan', 'Carter', '1982', 'Carter', 'the Carter Center', 'Carter', 'American', 'Israeli', 'U.S.', 'Carter', 'forty years', 'the age of 95']","['GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE']"
834,2002,July,9,"The African Union is established in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The first chairman is Thabo Mbeki, President of South Africa.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela,"Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (; Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla]; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.
A Xhosa, Mandela was born to the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following the Rivonia Trial.
Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison, and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term, and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.
Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the far-left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honours—including the Nobel Peace Prize—and became the subject of a cult of personality.

The series was broadcast by the cable network HBO in the United States. The Wire premiered on June 2, 2002 and ended on March 9, 2008, comprising 60 episodes over five seasons.
Set and produced in Baltimore, Maryland, The Wire introduces a different institution of the city and its relationship to law enforcement in each season, while retaining characters and advancing storylines from previous seasons. The five subjects are, in chronological order: the illegal drug trade, the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, education and schools, and the print news medium. The large cast consists mainly of actors who are little known for their other roles, as well as numerous real-life Baltimore and Maryland figures in guest and recurring roles. Simon has said that despite its framing as a crime drama, the show is ""really about the American city, and about how we live together. It's about how institutions have an effect on individuals. Whether one is a cop, a longshoreman, a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed.""The Wire is lauded for its literary themes, its uncommonly accurate exploration of society and politics, and its realistic portrayal of urban life. Although during its original run the series received only average ratings and never won any major television awards, it is now widely regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time.","{1272, 4993, 3842, 1795, 3459, 4994, 7, 2568, 4871, 2955, 2191, 2703, 3989, 4895, 4768, 1058, 3621, 1319, 1576, 5033, 1584, 563, 56, 2104, 4920, 3903, 4671, 3777, 452, 580, 964, 2119, 4430, 4558, 3578, 1491, 2004, 2388, 1622, 4307, 4437, 5077, 4445, 2152, 4330, 4971, 748, 1649, 1139, 4472, 889, 3322, 4605, 890, 3199}",55,"['The Wire', 'David Simon', 'Idris', 'Dominic West', 'HBO', 'American', 'David Simon', 'HBO', 'the United States', 'June 2, 2002', 'March 9, 2008', 'five seasons', 'Baltimore', 'Maryland', 'each season', 'previous seasons', 'Baltimore', 'Maryland', 'Simon', 'American']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP']"
840,2002,June,11,"""American Idol"" created by Simon Fuller with judges Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson premieres on Fox",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol,"American Idol is an American singing competition television series created by Simon Fuller, produced by FremantleMedia North America and 19 Entertainment, and distributed by Fremantle North America. It initially aired on Fox from June 11, 2002, to April 7, 2016, for 15 seasons. It had a hiatus for two years, until March 11, 2018, when a revival of the series aired on ABC.
It started as an addition to the Idols format that was based on Pop Idol from British television, and became one of the most successful shows in the history of American television. The concept of the series involves discovering recording stars from unsigned singing talents, with the winner determined by American viewers using phones, Internet, and SMS text voting. The winners of the first seventeen seasons, as chosen by viewers, are Kelly Clarkson, Ruben Studdard, Fantasia Barrino, Carrie Underwood, Taylor Hicks, Jordin Sparks, David Cook, Kris Allen, Lee DeWyze, Scotty McCreery, Phillip Phillips, Candice Glover, Caleb Johnson, Nick Fradiani, Trent Harmon, Maddie Poppe, and Laine Hardy respectively.
American Idol employs a panel of vocal judges who critique the contestants' performances. The original judges, for the first through eighth seasons, were record producer and music manager Randy Jackson, singer and choreographer Paula Abdul, and music executive and manager Simon Cowell. The judging panel for the last three seasons on Fox consisted of singers Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez, and Harry Connick Jr. The sixteenth season brought three new judges: singers Lionel Richie, Katy Perry, and Luke Bryan. The first season was hosted by radio personality Ryan Seacrest and comedian Brian Dunkleman, but Seacrest remained as the sole master of ceremonies for the rest of the series.
The success of American Idol has been described as ""unparalleled in broadcasting history"". A rival TV executive said the series was ""the most impactful show in the history of television"". It became a recognized springboard for launching the career of many artists as bona fide stars. According to Billboard magazine, in its first ten years, ""Idol has spawned 345 Billboard chart-toppers and a platoon of pop idols, including Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Chris Daughtry, Fantasia, Ruben Studdard, Jennifer Hudson, Clay Aiken, Adam Lambert, and Jordin Sparks while remaining a TV ratings juggernaut.""For an unprecedented eight consecutive years, from the 2003–04 television season through the 2010–11 season, either its performance show or result show was ranked number one in U.S. television ratings.","{4611, 2051, 7, 2568, 33, 4134, 1576, 561, 4661, 4671, 2112, 580, 583, 4683, 4174, 4688, 3154, 595, 2141, 620, 1133, 1646, 1136, 1139, 2169, 2171, 127, 640, 3201, 4235, 1678, 1168, 1177, 2210, 3243, 1709, 1711, 3759, 4785, 703, 3781, 1739, 4307, 3803, 4829, 3812, 3813, 4330, 748, 1260, 3308, 4845, 1272, 3834, 1275, 3322, 1282, 771, 1795, 3842, 3862, 4890, 290, 3365, 1319, 302, 815, 4400, 310, 1847, 826, 4413, 2379, 2891, 4430, 2388, 3413, 4437, 3927, 349, 1888, 1890, 870, 4971, 876, 1908, 4472, 889, 3451, 892, 4990, 3970, 387, 3459, 903, 2955, 3468, 3979, 3980, 1938, 5010, 3989, 1432, 4518, 4007, 5033, 5037, 2990, 4526, 4017, 2483, 3508, 4024, 3524, 970, 2507, 1486, 4558, 4051, 2004, 3029, 4563, 4568, 2016, 4589, 2039, 3578, 4605}",128,"['American Idol', 'Simon Fuller', 'Simon Cowell', 'Paula Abdul', 'Randy Jackson', 'Fox', 'American Idol', 'American', 'Simon Fuller', 'FremantleMedia North America', '19 Entertainment', 'Fremantle North America', 'Fox', 'June 11, 2002', 'April 7, 2016', '15 seasons', 'two years', 'March 11, 2018', 'ABC', 'British', 'American', 'American', 'the first seventeen seasons', 'Kelly Clarkson', 'Ruben Studdard', 'Fantasia Barrino', 'Carrie Underwood', 'Taylor Hicks', 'Jordin Sparks', 'David Cook', 'Kris Allen', 'Lee DeWyze', 'Scotty McCreery', 'Phillip Phillips', 'Candice Glover', 'Caleb Johnson', 'Nick Fradiani', 'Trent Harmon', 'Maddie Poppe', 'Laine Hardy', 'American', 'the first through eighth seasons', 'Randy Jackson', 'Paula Abdul', 'Simon Cowell', 'the last three seasons', 'Fox', 'Keith Urban', 'Jennifer Lopez', 'Harry Connick Jr.', 'The sixteenth season', 'Katy Perry', 'Luke Bryan', 'The first season', 'Ryan Seacrest', 'Brian Dunkleman', 'Seacrest', 'American Idol', 'Billboard', 'its first ten years', 'Billboard', 'Kelly Clarkson', 'Carrie Underwood', 'Chris Daughtry', 'Fantasia', 'Ruben Studdard', 'Jennifer Hudson', 'Clay Aiken', 'Adam Lambert', 'Jordin Sparks', 'an unprecedented eight consecutive years', 'the 2003–04 television season through the 2010–11 season', 'U.S.']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE']"

It was held from 9 June to 9 July 2006 in Germany, which won the right to host the event in July 2000. Teams representing 198 national football associations from all six populated continents participated in the qualification process which began in September 2003. Thirty-one teams qualified from this process, along with the host nation, Germany, for the finals tournament. It was the second time that Germany staged the competition, the first as a unified country (the other was in 1974 at the then-West Germany), and the tenth time that it was held in Europe.
Italy won the tournament, claiming their fourth World Cup title. They defeated France 5–3 in a penalty shoot-out in the final, after extra time had finished in a 1–1 draw. Germany defeated Portugal 3–1 to finish in third place. Angola, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Trinidad and Tobago, and Togo made their first appearances in the finals. It was also the only appearance of Serbia and Montenegro under that name; they had previously appeared in 1998 as Yugoslavia. In late May 2006, immediately prior to the tournament, Montenegro voted in a referendum to become an independent nation and dissolve the loose confederacy then existing between it and Serbia, with Serbia recognizing the results of the referendum in early June. Due to time constraints, FIFA had Serbia and Montenegro play in the World Cup tournament as one team, marking the first instance of multiple sovereign nations competing as one team in a major football tournament since UEFA Euro 1992.
The 2006 World Cup stands as one of the most watched events in television history, garnering an estimated 26.29 billion times viewed, compiled over the course of the tournament.

It was the 126th edition of the Wimbledon Championships and were held from 25 June to 8 July 2012. It was the third Grand Slam tennis event of the year and was part of the ATP World Tour, the WTA Tour, the ITF Junior Tour and the NEC Tour. The championships were organised by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and the International Tennis Federation.
Both Novak Djokovic and Petra Kvitová were unsuccessful in their 2011 title defences, both being defeated by the eventual champions: Djokovic was defeated by Roger Federer in the semifinals, and Kvitová lost to Serena Williams in the quarterfinals. In four sets, Federer defeated Andy Murray to win a record-equalling seven Wimbledon titles, while Murray became the first British male player to reach a Wimbledon singles final in the Open era. Williams defeated first-time Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwańska in three sets to equal her sister Venus in winning five Wimbledon titles. Both Federer and Williams were more than 30 years old at the time of their victories. With the victories, Federer reclaimed the World No. 1 ranking for the first time since June 2010, thus allowing him to equal, then break, the all-time record of most weeks ranked World No. 1 held by Pete Sampras. Agnieszka Radwanska, Victoria Azarenka, and Maria Sharapova were in contention for the world number 1 ranking. Since Sharapova lost in the fourth round and Radwanska was a match away from becoming the world number 1 but lost it, Azarenka continued her success as the number 1.","{7, 3601, 1555, 1058, 4642, 3621, 1584, 4661, 2102, 2104, 1084, 2112, 580, 1622, 2152, 1646, 1649, 2171, 127, 640, 130, 4235, 2703, 3727, 1170, 1683, 1177, 4768, 3234, 4775, 1193, 3243, 1709, 3252, 3777, 1233, 4307, 3812, 3813, 4330, 4845, 762, 3322, 3842, 1292, 1295, 795, 4895, 4905, 810, 3882, 2869, 4917, 4923, 4924, 4413, 3908, 3399, 2891, 4944, 2388, 3413, 3927, 1888, 1890, 874, 1386, 4971, 367, 1907, 4472, 889, 4986, 3451, 4993, 4994, 2955, 3979, 3989, 3481, 3482, 3999, 1960, 4526, 2483, 1465, 1979, 452, 964, 3524, 4051, 2004, 4563, 5077, 1502, 5097, 3578, 4605}",98,"[""Wimbledon Women's"", 'Serena Williams', 'Wimbledon', 'The 2012 Wimbledon Championships', 'Wimbledon', 'London', 'England', 'the Wimbledon Championships', '25 June to 8 July 2012', 'Grand Slam', 'the year', 'the ATP World Tour', 'the WTA Tour', 'the ITF Junior Tour', 'the NEC Tour', 'the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club', 'the International Tennis Federation', 'Novak Djokovic', 'Petra Kvitová', '2011', 'Djokovic', 'Roger Federer', 'Kvitová', 'Serena Williams', 'Federer', 'Andy Murray', 'Wimbledon', 'Murray', 'British', 'Wimbledon', 'Williams', 'Wimbledon', 'Agnieszka Radwańska', 'Venus', 'Wimbledon', 'Federer', 'Williams', 'more than 30 years old', 'Federer', 'the World No. 1', 'June 2010', 'most weeks', 'World No. 1', 'Pete Sampras', 'Agnieszka Radwanska', 'Victoria Azarenka', 'Maria Sharapova', 'Sharapova', 'Radwanska', 'Azarenka']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON']"

Widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers ever, and regarded by some as the greatest of all time, Schumacher is the only driver in history to win seven Formula One World Championships, five of which he won consecutively. The most successful driver in the history of the sport, Schumacher holds the records for the most World Championship titles (7), the most Grand Prix wins (91), the most fastest laps (77) and the most races won in a single season (13), and according to the official Formula One website (Formula1.com), Schumacher was ""statistically the greatest driver the sport has ever seen"" at the time of his retirement from the sport. He was also noted throughout his career for pushing his car to the very limit for sustained periods and a pioneering fitness regime.After success in karting as a child, Schumacher won titles in Formula König and Formula Three before joining Mercedes in the World Sportscar Championship. In 1991 his Mercedes-funded race debut for the Jordan Formula One team resulted in Schumacher being signed by Benetton for the rest of that season. He finished third in 1992 and fourth in 1993, before becoming the first German World Drivers' Champion in 1994 by one point over Damon Hill, albeit in controversial circumstances. In 1995 he repeated the success, this time with a greater margin. In 1996 Schumacher moved to Ferrari, who had last won the Drivers' Championship in 1979, and helped them transform into the most successful team in Formula One history, as he came close to winning the 1997 and 1998 titles, before breaking his leg at the 1999 British Grand Prix, ending another title run.
Schumacher won five consecutive drivers' titles from 2000 to 2004, including an unprecedented sixth and seventh title. In 2002 Schumacher won the title with a record six races remaining and finished on the podium in every race. In 2004 Schumacher won twelve out of the first thirteen races and went on to win a record 13 times as he won his final title. Schumacher retired from Formula One in 2006, after finishing runner-up to Renault's Fernando Alonso. Schumacher returned to Formula One in 2010 with Mercedes. He produced the fastest qualifying time at the 2012 Monaco Grand Prix, and achieved his only podium on his return at the 2012 European Grand Prix, where he finished third. In October 2012 Schumacher announced he would retire for a second time at the end of the season.His career was at times controversial, as he was twice involved in collisions in the final race of a season that determined the outcome of the World Championship, with Damon Hill in 1994 in Adelaide, and with Jacques Villeneuve in 1997 in Jerez. Schumacher is an ambassador for UNESCO and has been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts throughout his life, donating tens of millions of dollars to charity. Schumacher and his younger brother, Ralf, are the only siblings to win races in Formula One, and they were the first brothers to finish 1st and 2nd in the same race, a feat they repeated in four subsequent races.
On 29 December 2013 Schumacher suffered severe brain injury in a skiing accident. He was placed in a medically induced coma for six months until 16 June 2014. He left the hospital in Grenoble for further rehabilitation at the University Hospital of Lausanne. On 9 September 2014, Schumacher was relocated to his home where he continues to receive medical treatment and rehabilitation privately. As of 2016, he remained unable to walk or stand. In July 2019, former Ferrari manager Jean Todt said that Schumacher was making ""good progress"" but also ""struggles to communicate"".","{640, 3989, 4758, 4134, 2861, 561, 4024, 186, 4539, 4682, 4815, 3666, 595, 2388, 4691, 2529, 997, 1261, 4078, 4589, 3952, 4722, 3451}",23,"['German', 'Ferrari', 'Michael Schumacher', 'World Drivers Championship', 'the French Grand Prix', 'Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours', '3rd', 'Michael Schumacher', 'German', '3 January 1969', 'German', 'Formula One', 'Jordan Grand Prix', 'Benetton', 'Ferrari', 'Mercedes', 'Formula', 'Schumacher', 'Formula One', 'Schumacher', 'World Championship', 'Grand Prix', '77', 'a single season', 'Formula One', 'Schumacher', 'Schumacher', 'Formula König', 'Formula Three', 'Mercedes', '1991', 'Mercedes', 'Jordan Formula One', 'Schumacher', 'Benetton', '1992', '1993', ""German World Drivers'"", '1994', 'Damon Hill', '1995', '1996', 'Schumacher', 'Ferrari', ""the Drivers' Championship"", '1979', 'Formula One', '1997', '1998', 'the 1999', 'British Grand Prix', '2000 to 2004', '2002', 'Schumacher', '2004', 'Schumacher', 'Formula One', '2006', 'Renault', 'Fernando Alonso', 'Schumacher', 'Formula One', '2010', 'Mercedes', 'the 2012 Monaco Grand Prix', 'the 2012 European Grand Prix', 'October 2012', 'Schumacher', 'the end of the season', 'a season', 'the World Championship', 'Damon Hill', '1994', 'Adelaide', 'Jacques Villeneuve', '1997', 'Jerez', 'Schumacher', 'UNESCO', 'Schumacher', 'Ralf', 'Formula One', '2nd', '29 December 2013', 'Schumacher', 'six months', '16 June 2014', 'Grenoble', 'the University Hospital of Lausanne', '9 September 2014', 'Schumacher', '2016', 'July 2019', 'Ferrari', 'Jean Todt', 'Schumacher']","['NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON']"

After the biggest series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, New York Times writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet: the United States and worldwide public opinion.These demonstrations against the war were mainly organized by anti-war organizations, many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan. In some Arab countries demonstrations were organized by the state. Europe saw the biggest mobilization of protesters, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally.According to the French academic Dominique Reynié, between January 3 and April 12, 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.In the United States, even though pro-war demonstrators have been quoted as referring to anti-war protests as a ""vocal minority"", Gallup Polls updated September 14, 2007 state, ""Since the summer of 2005, opponents of the war have tended to outnumber supporters. A majority of Americans believe the war was a mistake.""From the protests before and during the Iraq War, this was one of the biggest global peace protests to occur in the early 21st century, since the 20th century protest of the Vietnam War. This was later contributed to Anti-Japanese demonstrations which erupt in China, Taiwan, and South Korea in 2005.","{4611, 1539, 2568, 524, 528, 3091, 1557, 28, 2590, 2078, 4642, 1576, 2092, 1081, 58, 4671, 66, 3139, 1616, 4688, 97, 1634, 3686, 1640, 1133, 110, 3186, 3190, 3702, 2169, 2682, 2171, 2684, 128, 4736, 2702, 144, 661, 1177, 157, 2210, 3243, 174, 4785, 690, 1204, 4276, 3268, 4307, 4826, 4829, 748, 1780, 1795, 3332, 4871, 278, 4889, 1309, 3874, 1319, 1832, 3371, 4398, 4400, 3382, 1847, 4407, 826, 4422, 4426, 4430, 2388, 3413, 2391, 3927, 1370, 1373, 3427, 4971, 3951, 370, 3954, 4983, 890, 3451, 4990, 386, 3459, 903, 4489, 1419, 1931, 2955, 1934, 3979, 1938, 2964, 1432, 2982, 4007, 5033, 4020, 1464, 1977, 2489, 1979, 3516, 4536, 5054, 1985, 452, 965, 1990, 2507, 2508, 1997, 5077, 472, 2525, 2529, 2018, 4074, 4589, 1017, 3578, 4605}",127,"['Iraq', '2002', '2003', 'Iraq', 'the Iraq War', 'February 15, 2003', 'New York Times', 'Patrick Tyler', 'the United States', 'Afghanistan', 'Arab', 'Europe', 'Rome', 'the Guinness Book of Records', 'French', 'Dominique Reynié', 'between January 3 and April 12, 2003', 'the Iraq war', 'the United States', 'Gallup Polls', 'September 14, 2007', 'the summer of 2005', 'Americans', 'the Iraq War', 'the early 21st century', 'the 20th century', 'the Vietnam War', 'Anti-Japanese', 'China', 'Taiwan', 'South Korea', '2005']","['GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE']"

856,2003,March,19,"Airstrikes by an American and British-led coalition signal the beginning of the Invasion of Iraq, without United Nations support and in defiance of world opinion",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq,"The 2003 invasion of Iraq was the first stage of the Iraq War. The invasion phase began on 19 March 2003 (air) and 20 March 2003 (ground) and lasted just over one month, including 26 days of major combat operations, in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland invaded Iraq. This early stage of the war formally ended on 1 May 2003 when U.S. President George W. Bush declared the ""end of major combat operations"", after which the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was established as the first of several successive transitional governments leading up to the first Iraqi parliamentary election in January 2005. U.S. military forces later remained in Iraq until the withdrawal in 2011.The U.S.-led coalition sent 177,194 troops into Iraq during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 1 May 2003. About 130,000 arrived from the U.S. alone, with about 45,000 British soldiers, 2,000 Australian soldiers, and 194 Polish soldiers. 36 other countries were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops assembled in Kuwait by 18 February. The coalition forces also received support from the Peshmerga in Iraqi Kurdistan.
According to U.S. President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, the coalition aimed ""to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people."" Others place a much greater emphasis on the impact of the September 11 attacks, on the role this played in changing U.S. strategic calculations, and the rise of the freedom agenda. According to Blair, the trigger was Iraq's failure to take a ""final opportunity"" to disarm itself of alleged nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that U.S. and British officials called an immediate and intolerable threat to world peace.In a January 2003 CBS poll, 64% of Americans had approved of military action against Iraq; however, 63% wanted Bush to find a diplomatic solution rather than go to war, and 62% believed the threat of terrorism directed against the U.S. would increase due to war. The invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some long-standing U.S. allies, including the governments of France, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand. Their leaders argued that there was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that invading that country was not justified in the context of UNMOVIC's 12 February 2003 report. About 5,000 chemical warheads, shells or aviation bombs were discovered during the Iraq War, but these had been built and abandoned earlier in Saddam Hussein's rule before the 1991 Gulf War. The discoveries of these chemical weapons did not support the government's invasion rationale.On 15 February 2003, a month before the invasion, there were worldwide protests against the Iraq War, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which the Guinness Book of Records listed as the largest ever anti-war rally. According to the French academic Dominique Reynié, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.The invasion was preceded by an airstrike on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 20 March 2003. The following day, coalition forces launched an incursion into Basra Province from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While special forces launched an amphibious assault from the Persian Gulf to secure Basra and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the Battle of Nasiriyah on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command-and-control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March, the 173rd Airborne Brigade was airdropped near the northern city of Kirkuk, where they joined forces with Kurdish rebels and fought several actions against the Iraqi Army to secure the northern part of the country.
The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and the coalition occupied Baghdad on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi Army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack on and capture of Tikrit on 15 April. Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May President George W. Bush declared an end to major combat operations: this ended the invasion period and began the period of military occupation.","{4611, 7, 2568, 1547, 528, 1041, 2590, 2080, 3110, 4134, 1576, 4138, 1583, 561, 4671, 2122, 4682, 595, 606, 1633, 3180, 1133, 1649, 3186, 3190, 3702, 2169, 3195, 2171, 128, 640, 1153, 4605, 3207, 1162, 4235, 4750, 2703, 3727, 4768, 2210, 680, 1711, 1204, 3252, 3268, 3272, 4815, 3795, 4307, 3804, 1757, 1251, 2278, 2793, 234, 2794, 748, 3834, 3322, 3842, 1795, 1288, 4879, 4895, 290, 3365, 807, 1319, 4905, 2861, 4398, 4400, 1847, 4407, 4920, 826, 2875, 4413, 4422, 2891, 4940, 4942, 2388, 2901, 2391, 1888, 355, 3427, 4971, 1388, 2415, 3954, 889, 4474, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 3459, 903, 1419, 2955, 3468, 3979, 1424, 3989, 1432, 418, 4007, 5033, 4024, 1979, 4539, 453, 965, 967, 1990, 4549, 971, 2507, 5074, 467, 5077, 3034, 1502, 2529, 2018, 1508, 997, 2026, 4589, 5107, 1526, 5117}",135,"['American', 'British', 'the Invasion of Iraq', 'United Nations', '2003', 'Iraq', 'the Iraq War', '19 March 2003', 'March 2003', 'one month', '26 days', 'the United States', 'the United Kingdom', 'Australia', 'Poland', 'Iraq', 'U.S.', 'George W.

The country was also an associate member of the Western European Union from 1992 to its end in 2011.

Negotiations for full membership were started on 3 October 2005. Progress was slow, and out of the 35 Chapters necessary to complete the accession process only 16 had been opened and one had been closed by May 2016. The early 2016 refugee deal between Turkey and the European Union was intended to accelerate negotiations after previous stagnation and allow visa-free travel through Europe for Turks.Since 2016 accession negotiations have stalled.

Its main purpose was to train the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and assist Afghanistan in rebuilding key government institutions, but was also engaged in the War in Afghanistan (2001–14) against the Taliban insurgency.
ISAF was initially charged with securing Kabul and the surrounding areas from the Taliban, al Qaeda and factional warlords, to allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai. In October 2003, the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan, and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country. From 2006 to 2011, ISAF became increasingly involved in more intensive combat operations in southern and eastern Afghanistan.
Troop contributors included the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and other  NATO member states as well as a number of other countries. The intensity of the combat faced by contributing nations varied greatly, with the United States sustaining  the most casualties overall. In early 2010, there were at least 700 military bases inside Afghanistan. About 400 of these were used by American‑led NATO forces and 300 by the ANSF.ISAF ceased combat operations and was disbanded in December 2014, with some troops remaining behind in an advisory role as part of ISAF's successor organization, the Resolute Support Mission.","{865, 2100, 463}",3,"['NATO', 'Afghanistan', 'Europe', 'NATO', 'Afghanistan', 'the United Nations Security Council', 'December 2001', 'Resolution 1386', 'the Bonn Agreement', 'the Afghan National Security Forces', 'Afghanistan', 'War', 'Afghanistan', 'Taliban', 'Kabul', 'Taliban', 'al Qaeda', 'the Afghan Transitional Administration', 'Hamid Karzai', 'October 2003', 'the UN Security Council', 'ISAF', 'Afghanistan', 'ISAF', '2006 to 2011', 'ISAF', 'Afghanistan', 'the United States', 'United Kingdom', 'Canada', 'NATO', 'the United States', 'early 2010', 'Afghanistan', 'NATO', 'December 2014', 'ISAF', 'the Resolute Support Mission']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG']"
862,2003,December,13,"Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is captured near his home town of Tikrit, during Operation Red Dawn by US forces",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq,"The 2003 invasion of Iraq was the first stage of the Iraq War. The invasion phase began on 19 March 2003 (air) and 20 March 2003 (ground) and lasted just over one month, including 26 days of major combat operations, in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland invaded Iraq. This early stage of the war formally ended on 1 May 2003 when U.S. President George W. Bush declared the ""end of major combat operations"", after which the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was established as the first of several successive transitional governments leading up to the first Iraqi parliamentary election in January 2005. U.S. military forces later remained in Iraq until the withdrawal in 2011.The U.S.-led coalition sent 177,194 troops into Iraq during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 1 May 2003. About 130,000 arrived from the U.S. alone, with about 45,000 British soldiers, 2,000 Australian soldiers, and 194 Polish soldiers. 36 other countries were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops assembled in Kuwait by 18 February. The coalition forces also received support from the Peshmerga in Iraqi Kurdistan.
According to U.S. President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, the coalition aimed ""to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people."" Others place a much greater emphasis on the impact of the September 11 attacks, on the role this played in changing U.S. strategic calculations, and the rise of the freedom agenda. According to Blair, the trigger was Iraq's failure to take a ""final opportunity"" to disarm itself of alleged nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that U.S. and British officials called an immediate and intolerable threat to world peace.In a January 2003 CBS poll, 64% of Americans had approved of military action against Iraq; however, 63% wanted Bush to find a diplomatic solution rather than go to war, and 62% believed the threat of terrorism directed against the U.S. would increase due to war. The invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some long-standing U.S. allies, including the governments of France, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand. Their leaders argued that there was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that invading that country was not justified in the context of UNMOVIC's 12 February 2003 report. About 5,000 chemical warheads, shells or aviation bombs were discovered during the Iraq War, but these had been built and abandoned earlier in Saddam Hussein's rule before the 1991 Gulf War. The discoveries of these chemical weapons did not support the government's invasion rationale.On 15 February 2003, a month before the invasion, there were worldwide protests against the Iraq War, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which the Guinness Book of Records listed as the largest ever anti-war rally. According to the French academic Dominique Reynié, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.The invasion was preceded by an airstrike on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 20 March 2003. The following day, coalition forces launched an incursion into Basra Province from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While special forces launched an amphibious assault from the Persian Gulf to secure Basra and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the Battle of Nasiriyah on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command-and-control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March, the 173rd Airborne Brigade was airdropped near the northern city of Kirkuk, where they joined forces with Kurdish rebels and fought several actions against the Iraqi Army to secure the northern part of the country.
The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and the coalition occupied Baghdad on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi Army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack on and capture of Tikrit on 15 April. Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May President George W. Bush declared an end to major combat operations: this ended the invasion period and began the period of military occupation.","{4611, 4101, 7, 2568, 521, 3090, 1562, 2589, 2590, 2078, 2080, 1573, 3110, 4134, 1576, 4647, 1583, 2096, 561, 4671, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4688, 595, 1622, 2649, 606, 1633, 3581, 619, 2155, 1133, 3180, 3693, 1136, 1649, 3186, 1653, 3190, 3702, 2169, 2682, 3195, 2170, 2171, 128, 640, 1153, 131, 3207, 1162, 4235, 4750, 2703, 3727, 4758, 4768, 2210, 2213, 680, 1204, 1730, 3268, 3272, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 4313, 1757, 3805, 3808, 1251, 2278, 3303, 2793, 234, 2794, 748, 2798, 3322, 1275, 3834, 4859, 3842, 1795, 1288, 4879, 1808, 3869, 4895, 290, 3365, 807, 4905, 2861, 4398, 4400, 4916, 309, 311, 1847, 4920, 826, 2875, 4413, 4422, 2891, 4940, 4942, 2388, 2901, 2391, 4445, 1888, 3427, 4971, 1388, 2415, 3954, 889, 4474, 3451, 4990, 4993, 3970, 3459, 3460, 903, 1419, 2955, 3979, 1422, 1424, 3989, 1432, 418, 4007, 5033, 4014, 2995, 4024, 1979, 4539, 453, 965, 967, 1990, 4549, 5065, 971, 2507, 1997, 2508, 5074, 467, 5077, 5079, 3544, 3034, 1502, 3040, 2529, 2018, 1508, 997, 492, 4589, 5106, 5107, 1526, 2040, 5117}",176,"['Iraqi', 'Saddam Hussein', 'Tikrit', 'Operation Red Dawn', 'US', '2003', 'Iraq', 'the Iraq War', '19 March 2003', 'March 2003', 'one month', '26 days', 'the United States', 'the United Kingdom', 'Australia', 'Poland', 'Iraq', 'U.S.', 'George W.

R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The film is the third instalment in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and was produced by Barrie M. Osborne, Jackson and Fran Walsh, and written by Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Jackson. The film features an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Bernard Hill, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Hugo Weaving, Miranda Otto, David Wenham, Karl Urban, John Noble, Andy Serkis, Ian Holm, and Sean Bean. It was preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) and The Two Towers (2002).
Continuing the plot of The Two Towers, Frodo, Sam and Gollum are making their final way toward Mount Doom in Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, unaware of Gollum's true intentions, while Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the rest are joining forces together against Sauron and his legions in Minas Tirith.
The Return of the King was financed and distributed by American studio New Line Cinema, but filmed and edited entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand, concurrently with the other two parts of the trilogy. It premiered on 1 December 2003 at the Embassy Theatre in Wellington and was theatrically released on 17 December 2003 in the United States, and on 18 December 2003 in New Zealand. The film was highly acclaimed by critics and fans alike, who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and an achievement in the fantasy film genre. It grossed $1.142 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2003 and the second highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release, as well as being only the second film in history to cross the $1 billion mark at the global box office.The Return of the King is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential fantasy films ever made. The film received numerous accolades; at the 76th Academy Awards it won all eleven awards for which it was nominated: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Makeup, Best Original Score, Best Original Song for ""Into the West"", Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects, therefore tying for the record for the most Academy Awards won by a single film and holding the record for the highest clean sweep at the Oscars.","{1025, 3970, 4611, 1795, 3459, 903, 2568, 1419, 2955, 4235, 2191, 1168, 1938, 2322, 3989, 1432, 794, 925, 290, 2210, 2214, 1319, 1576, 4007, 4134, 4518, 5033, 2171, 4400, 3508, 1847, 4024, 4407, 826, 4536, 2620, 4413, 4920, 832, 1990, 967, 2119, 1483, 2507, 4300, 4174, 4430, 4683, 5074, 467, 2388, 4307, 2262, 2391, 4691, 1502, 1888, 3040, 2018, 3171, 997, 3046, 874, 748, 1260, 4589, 625, 1908, 1653, 3190, 2169, 3451, 4605, 4990, 895}",75,"['The Return of the King""', 'Peter Jackson', 'Elijah Wood', 'Ian McKellen', 'Wellington', 'New Zealand', '2003', 'Peter Jackson', ""J.

865,2003,November,17,"Britney Spears, at 21 years old, becomes the youngest singer to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears,"Britney Jean Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. Born in McComb, Mississippi and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, she appeared in stage productions and television series, before signing with Jive Records in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the ""Princess of Pop"", Spears is regarded as a pop icon and is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Spears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, Britney (2001) and In the Zone (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in Crossroads (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior beginning in 2006, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album Blackout (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work. Spears' personal struggles led her to be placed on a still ongoing conservatorship. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, Circus (2008) and Femme Fatale (2011), respectively. In 2012, Forbes reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58 million, having last topped the list in 2002. During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, Britney Jean (2013) and Glory (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year concert residency, Britney: Piece of Me, at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her conservator, leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team.
Spears has scored six number one albums on the Billboard 200, making her the third best performing female artist on the chart. Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100: ""...Baby One More Time"", ""Womanizer"", ""3"", ""Hold It Against Me"", and ""S&M"". Other singles, ""Oops!...

In singles, Agassi is an eight-time Grand Slam champion and a 1996 Olympic gold medalist, as well as being a runner-up in seven other Grand Slam tournaments.
During the Open Era, Agassi was the first male player to win four Australian Open titles, a record that was later surpassed by Novak Djokovic when he won his fifth title in 2015, and then by Roger Federer in 2017. Agassi is 2nd of five male singles players to achieve the Career Grand Slam in the Open Era after Rod Laver and before Federer, Nadal and Djokovic and fifth of eight in history, the first of two to achieve the Career Golden Slam (Career Grand Slam and Olympic Gold Medal, the other being Rafael Nadal), and the only man to win the Career Golden Slam and the ATP Tour World Championships: a distinction dubbed as a ""Career Super Slam"" by Sports Illustrated.Agassi was the first male player to win all four Grand Slam tournaments on three different surfaces (hard, clay and grass), and the last American male to win both the French Open (in 1999) and the Australian Open (in 2003). He also won 17 ATP Masters Series titles and was part of the winning Davis Cup teams in 1990, 1992 and 1995. Agassi reached the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in 1995 but was troubled by personal issues during the mid-to-late 1990s and sank to No. 141 in 1997, prompting many to believe that his career was over. Agassi returned to No. 1 in 1999 and enjoyed the most successful run of his career over the next four years. During his 20-plus year tour career, Agassi was known by the nickname ""The Punisher"".After suffering from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back, a spondylolisthesis (vertebral displacement) and a bone spur that interfered with the nerve, Agassi retired from professional tennis on September 3, 2006, after losing in the third round of the US Open to Benjamin Becker. He is the founder of the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation, which has raised over $60 million for at-risk children in Southern Nevada. In 2001, the Foundation opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas, a K-12 public charter school for at-risk children. He has been married to fellow tennis player Steffi Graf since 2001.","{1025, 2051, 4101, 2568, 3596, 3597, 3598, 3601, 2066, 1555, 1052, 1058, 4642, 3109, 1576, 1583, 563, 2104, 4671, 2112, 3137, 4682, 4688, 2645, 1622, 2141, 3686, 4714, 620, 3693, 1646, 2159, 1136, 1649, 1651, 2679, 3705, 2169, 2682, 127, 640, 1162, 3722, 3724, 2703, 3727, 1177, 4768, 1185, 680, 682, 3244, 1710, 3759, 176, 2740, 4286, 703, 2242, 1732, 3272, 4307, 213, 3803, 3812, 3303, 234, 748, 4853, 2809, 1795, 1291, 782, 1294, 3862, 795, 4895, 810, 812, 302, 4920, 4924, 2891, 4942, 2899, 2388, 4437, 3927, 4957, 1374, 2911, 1888, 3936, 1890, 3427, 874, 1386, 3434, 4971, 2415, 1907, 3451, 381, 4993, 4994, 387, 2435, 3459, 903, 2955, 3979, 1423, 4496, 2964, 3989, 3994, 5019, 1960, 2984, 3500, 434, 2483, 4024, 4539, 452, 965, 1990, 3524, 4549, 2509, 1486, 4558, 4051, 5077, 987, 2529, 4578, 5092, 4589, 495, 5107, 1526, 4605}",143,"['Andre Agassi', 'ATP', '33 years', '13 days', 'Andre Kirk Agassi', 'AG', 'April 29, 1970', 'American', 'the late 1980s', 'the early 2000s', 'Agassi', 'Grand Slam', '1996', 'Olympic', 'Grand Slam', 'Agassi', 'Australian', 'Novak Djokovic', '2015', 'Roger Federer', '2017', 'Agassi', 'the Career Grand Slam', 'Rod Laver', 'Federer', 'Nadal', 'Djokovic', 'the Career Golden Slam', 'Olympic Gold Medal', 'Rafael Nadal', 'the Career Golden Slam', 'Career Super Slam', 'Sports Illustrated', 'Agassi', 'Grand Slam', 'American', 'French', '1999', 'Australian', '2003', 'Series', 'Davis Cup', '1990', '1992', '1995', 'Agassi', '1995', '1997', 'Agassi', '1999', 'the next four years', 'year', 'Agassi', 'The Punisher""', 'Agassi', 'September 3, 2006', 'the US Open', 'Benjamin Becker', 'the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation', 'Southern Nevada', '2001', 'Foundation', 'the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy', 'Las Vegas', 'Steffi Graf', '2001']","['PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"

869,2003,November,16,Lionel Messi makes his official debut for FC Barcelona in a friendly against Porto,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi,"Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾez ˈmesi] (listen); born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward and captains both Spanish club Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record six Ballon d'Or awards, and a record six European Golden Shoes. He has spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he has won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, four UEFA Champions League titles and six Copas del Rey. A prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (438), a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (181) and the Copa América (12). He has scored over 700 senior career goals for club and country.
Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning three consecutive Ballons d'Or, including an unprecedented fourth. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed the captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he secured a record sixth Ballon d'Or.
An Argentine international, Messi is his country's all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup during the 2006 edition, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copas América. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América.
One of the most famous athletes in the world, Messi has been sponsored by sportswear company Adidas since 2006 and has established himself as their leading brand endorser. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. In 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year.

She went on to star in Anaconda (1997) and Out of Sight (1998), later establishing herself as the highest-paid Latin actress in Hollywood.Lopez ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album On the 6 (1999), which helped propel the Latin pop movement in American music. With the simultaneous release of her second studio album J.Lo and her romantic comedy The Wedding Planner in 2001, Lopez became the first woman to have a number one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes, became the first in history to debut at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200. Later that year, she released her third studio album This Is Me... Then, and starred in the US box office number-one Maid in Manhattan.
After starring in Gigli (2003), a critical and commercial failure, Lopez subsequently starred in the successful romantic comedies Shall We Dance? (2004) and Monster-in-Law (2005). Her fifth studio album, Como Ama una Mujer (2007), received the highest first-week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States. Following an unsuccessful period, she returned to prominence in 2011 with her appearance as a judge on American Idol, and released her seventh studio album Love?. From 2016 to 2018, she starred in the crime drama series Shades of Blue and performed a residency show, Jennifer Lopez: All I Have, at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. Since 2017, Lopez has produced and served as a judge on World of Dance. In 2019, she received critical praise for starring as a stripper in the crime drama Hustlers, for which she earned Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.
With a cumulative film gross of US$3.1 billion and estimated global sales of 70 million records, Lopez is regarded as the most influential Latin performer in the United States. In 2012, Forbes ranked her as the most powerful celebrity in the world, as well as the 38th most powerful woman in the world. Time listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2018. Her most successful singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 include: ""If You Had My Love"", ""I'm Real"", ""Ain't It Funny"", ""All I Have"", and ""On the Floor"", which is one of the best-selling singles of all time.

877,2004,April,8,Darfur conflict: The Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement is signed by the Sudanese government and two rebel groups,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Darfur,"The War in Darfur, also nicknamed the Land Cruiser War, is a major armed conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan that began in February 2003 when the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebel groups began fighting the government of Sudan, which they accused of oppressing Darfur's non-Arab population. The government responded to attacks by carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Darfur's non-Arabs. This resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of civilians and the indictment of Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court.One side of the conflict is mainly composed of the Sudanese military, police and the Janjaweed, a Sudanese militia group whose members are mostly recruited among Arabized indigenous Africans and a small number of Bedouin of the northern Rizeigat; the majority of other Arab groups in Darfur remained uninvolved.
The other side is made up of rebel groups, notably the SLM/A and the JEM, recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit ethnic groups. The African Union and the United Nations also have a joint peacekeeping mission in the region, named UNAMID. Although the Sudanese government publicly denies that it supported the Janjaweed, evidence supports claims that it provided financial assistance and weapons and coordinated joint attacks, many against civilians. Estimates of the number of human casualties range up to several hundred thousand dead, from either combat or starvation and disease. Mass displacements and coercive migrations forced millions into refugee camps or across the border, creating a humanitarian crisis. Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell described the situation as a genocide or acts of genocide.The Sudanese government and the JEM signed a ceasefire agreement in February 2010, with a tentative agreement to pursue peace. The JEM has the most to gain from the talks and could see semi-autonomy much like South Sudan. However, talks were disrupted by accusations that the Sudanese army launched raids and air strikes against a village, violating the Tolu agreement. The JEM, the largest rebel group in Darfur, vowed to boycott negotiations.The August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration, signed by military and civilian representatives during the Sudanese Revolution, requires that a peace process leading to a peace agreement be made in Darfur and other regions of armed conflict in Sudan within the first six months of the 39-month transition period to democratic civilian government.","{1378, 4741}",2,"['Darfur', 'Sudanese', 'Darfur', 'Darfur', 'Sudan', 'February 2003', 'the Sudan Liberation Movement', 'SLM', 'Justice', 'Equality Movement', 'Sudan', 'Darfur', 'non-Arab', 'Darfur', 'non-Arabs', 'Sudan', 'Omar al-Bashir', 'the International Criminal Court', 'Sudanese', 'Janjaweed', 'Sudanese', 'Arabized', 'Africans', 'Bedouin', 'Rizeigat', 'Arab', 'Darfur', 'Zaghawa', 'Masalit', 'The African Union', 'the United Nations', 'UNAMID', 'Sudanese', 'Janjaweed', 'US', 'State', 'Colin Powell', 'Sudanese', 'JEM', 'February 2010', 'JEM', 'South Sudan', 'Sudanese', 'Tolu', 'Darfur', 'August 2019', 'Draft Constitutional Declaration', 'the Sudanese Revolution', 'Darfur', 'Sudan', 'the first six months']","['GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE']"
878,2004,May,17,Massachusetts becomes the first U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States,"Same-sex marriage in the United States expanded from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015 through various state court rulings, state legislation, direct popular votes, and federal court rulings. Same-sex marriage is also referred to as gay marriage, while the political status in which the marriages of same-sex couples and the marriages of opposite-sex couples are recognized as equal by the law is referred to as marriage equality. The fifty states each have separate marriage laws, which must adhere to rulings by the Supreme Court of the United States that recognize marriage as a fundamental right that is guaranteed by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as first established in the 1967 landmark civil rights case of Loving v. Virginia.
Civil rights campaigning in support of marriage without distinction as to sex or sexual orientation began in the 1970s. In 1972, the now overturned Baker v. Nelson saw the Supreme Court of the United States decline to become involved. The issue became prominent from around 1993, when the Supreme Court of Hawaii ruled in Baehr v. Lewin that it was unconstitutional under the Constitution of Hawaii for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. That ruling led to federal and state actions to explicitly abridge marriage on the basis of sex in order to prevent the marriages of same-sex couples from being recognized by law, the most prominent of which was the 1996 federal DOMA. In 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that it was unconstitutional under the Constitution of Massachusetts for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. From 2004 through to 2015, as the tide of public opinion continued to move towards support of same-sex marriage, various state court rulings, state legislation, direct popular votes (referendums and initiatives), and federal court rulings established same-sex marriage in thirty-six of the fifty states.
The first two decades of the 21st century saw same-sex marriage receive support from prominent figures in the civil rights movement, including Coretta Scott King, John Lewis, Julian Bond, and Mildred Loving. In May 2011, national public support for same-sex marriage rose above 50% for the first time. In May 2012, the NAACP, the leading African-American civil rights organization, declared its support for same-sex marriage and stated that it is a civil right. In June 2013, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down DOMA for violating the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in the landmark civil rights case of United States v. Windsor, leading to federal recognition of same-sex marriage, with federal benefits for married couples connected to either the state of residence or the state in which the marriage was solemnized. In May 2015, national public support for same-sex marriage rose to 60% for the first time. In June 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in the landmark civil rights case of Obergefell v. Hodges that the fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples, with all the accompanying rights and responsibilities, is guaranteed by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
The most prominent supporters of same-sex marriage are human rights and civil rights organizations as well as the medical and scientific communities, while the most prominent opponents are religious groups. The ruling of the Supreme Court in Obergefell occurred following decades of consistently rising national public support for same-sex marriage in the United States, with support continuing to rise thereafter.
A study of nationwide data from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation, resulting in approximately 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States. The United States is the most populous country in the world to have established same-sex marriage nationwide.",set(),0,"['Massachusetts', 'U.S.', 'the United States', '2004', '2015', 'the Supreme Court', 'the United States', 'the Due Process Clause', 'the Equal Protection Clause', 'the Fourteenth Amendment', 'the United States Constitution', '1967', 'Virginia', 'the 1970s', '1972', 'Baker', 'Nelson', 'the Supreme Court', 'the United States', 'around 1993', 'the Supreme Court of Hawaii', 'Baehr', 'the Constitution of Hawaii', '1996', '2003', 'the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court', 'Goodridge v.

879,2004,May,26,The United States Army veteran Terry Nichols is found guilty of 161 state murder charges for helping carry out the Oklahoma City bombing.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing,"The Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States, on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing happened at 9:02 am and killed at least 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed one-third of the building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652 million worth of damage. Local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies engaged in extensive rescue efforts in the wake of the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. Until the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States, and remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in the country's history.
Within 90 minutes of the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, a veteran of the Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives parked in front of the building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and unhappy about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.The official investigation, known as ""OKBOMB"", saw FBI agents conduct 28,000 interviews, amass 3.5 short tons (3,200 kg) of evidence, and collect nearly one billion pieces of information. The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997. McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001 at the U.S. Federal Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, and Nichols was sentenced to life in prison in 2004. Michael and Lori Fortier testified against McVeigh and Nichols; Michael was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to warn the United States government, and Lori received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony.
As a result of the bombing, the U.S. Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which tightened the standards for habeas corpus in the United States, as well as legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks. On April 19, 2000, the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated on the site of the Murrah Federal Building, commemorating the victims of the bombing. Remembrance services are held every year on April 19, at the time of the explosion.","{1025, 387, 4101, 523, 4758, 2995, 967, 970, 1739, 4815, 3154, 595, 467, 3666, 2141, 873, 3434, 1388, 3180, 1136}",20,"['The United States Army', 'Terry Nichols', 'Oklahoma City', 'Oklahoma City', 'the Alfred P.

881,2004,November,11,"Yasser Arafat's death through unidentified causes confirmed by Palestine Liberation Organization, Mahmoud Abbas elected PLO chairman minutes later.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas,"Hamas (Arabic: حماس Ḥamās, an acronym of حركة المقاومة الاسلامية Ḥarakat al-Muqāwamah al-ʾIslāmiyyah [Islamic Resistance Movement]) is a Palestinian Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist militant organization. It has a social service wing, Dawah, and a military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. It has been the de facto governing authority of the Gaza Strip since its takeover of that area in 2007. During this period it fought several wars with Israel. Israel, the United States and the European Union classify, either in whole or in part, Hamas as a terrorist organization. This classification is one among various and diverse international positions on the nature of Hamas.  Russia, China, and Turkey are some countries who view Hamas in a positive light.Hamas was founded in 1987, soon after the First Intifada broke out, as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, which in its Gaza branch had been non-confrontational towards Israel, refrained from resistance, and was hostile to the PLO. Co-founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin stated in 1987, and the Hamas Charter affirmed in 1988, that Hamas was founded to liberate Palestine, including modern-day Israel, from Israeli occupation and to establish an Islamic state in the area that is now Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The group has stated that it may accept a 10-year truce if Israel withdraws to the 1967 borders and allows Palestinian refugees from 1948, including their descendants, to return to what is now Israel, although clarifying that this does not mean recognition of Israel or the end of the conflict. Hamas's military wing objected to the truce offer.The military wing of Hamas has launched attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers, often describing them as retaliatory, in particular for assassinations of the upper echelon of their leadership. Tactics have included suicide bombings and, since 2001, rocket attacks. Hamas's rocket arsenal, though mainly consisting of short-range homemade Qassam rockets, also includes long-range weapons that have reached major Israeli cities including Tel Aviv and Haifa. The attacks on civilians have been condemned as war crimes and crimes against humanity by human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch. A 2017 Palestinian Center for Public Opinion poll in the Palestinian territories revealed that Hamas violence and rhetoric against Israelis are unpopular and that a majority of Palestinians would rather Hamas ""accept a permanent two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.""In the January 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections, Hamas won a plurality in the Palestinian Parliament, defeating the PLO-affiliated Fatah party. Following the elections, the Quartet (the United States, Russia, United Nations, and European Union) made future foreign assistance to the PA conditional upon the future government's commitment to non-violence, recognition of the state of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements. Hamas rejected those changes, which led to the Quartet suspending its foreign assistance program and Israel imposing economic sanctions on the Hamas-led administration. In March 2007, a national unity government headed by Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas was briefly formed, but this failed to restart international financial assistance. Tensions over control of Palestinian security forces soon erupted in the 2007 Battle of Gaza, after which Hamas took control of Gaza, while its officials were ousted from government positions in the West Bank.

The UNASUR Constitutive Treaty was signed on 23 May 2008, at the Third Summit of Heads of State, held in Brasília, Brazil. According to the Constitutive Treaty, the Union's headquarters will be located in Quito, Ecuador. On 1 December 2010, Uruguay became the ninth state to ratify the UNASUR treaty, thus giving the union full legality. As the Constitutive Treaty entered into force on 11 March 2011, UNASUR became a legal entity during a meeting of Foreign Ministers in Mitad del Mundo, Ecuador, where they had laid the foundation stone for the Secretariat Headquarters.In April 2018, six countries—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru—suspended their membership, and in August of the same year, Colombia announced its withdrawal from the organization.  In March 2019, Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro announced his country's intention to withdraw from the organization. On March 13, 2019, Ecuador announced that it will withdraw from the organization. The president of the country, Lenin Moreno, also asked the bloc to return the headquarters building of the organization, based in Quito.In January 2019, amid growing concern about Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro, a new group, PROSUR, has been advanced to ""counteract the influence of what countries in the region call a dictatorship in Venezuela"".  A Chilean summit to organize Prosur was held on 22 March 2019, and excluded Venezuela. Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru, Guyana and Suriname were invited to join the new regional bloc. On 10 March 2020, Uruguay officially announced its withdrawal from the organization.","{7, 1566, 1058, 1576, 1584, 4661, 2104, 4671, 580, 608, 2152, 130, 650, 4235, 144, 4768, 3243, 1709, 1711, 703, 3777, 1233, 4307, 3301, 4330, 748, 1783, 3322, 3842, 1795, 4871, 1292, 4895, 3874, 3365, 1319, 4905, 4400, 2869, 825, 1341, 4413, 3909, 4944, 2388, 3413, 4437, 874, 4971, 3436, 367, 4472, 889, 890, 4990, 4993, 4994, 3459, 2955, 3979, 4526, 4536, 1979, 3519, 452, 964, 3524, 1997, 4558, 4561, 2004, 5077, 2525, 1502, 3046, 5097, 3578, 2555, 4605}",79,"['Cuzco Declaration', 'Cuzco', 'Peru', 'the Union of South American Nations', 'The Union of South American Nations', 'USAN', 'Spanish', 'Unión de Naciones Suramericanas', 'UNASUR', 'Portuguese', 'União de Nações Sul-Americanas', 'UNASUL', 'Dutch', 'Unie van Zuid-Amerikaanse Naties', 'the South American Union', 'South American', '2019', 'The UNASUR Constitutive Treaty', '23 May 2008', 'the Third Summit of Heads of State', 'Brasília', 'Brazil', 'the Constitutive Treaty', 'Quito', 'Ecuador', '1 December 2010', 'the UNASUR treaty', 'the Constitutive Treaty', '11 March 2011', 'UNASUR', 'Foreign Ministers', 'Mitad del Mundo', 'Ecuador', 'the Secretariat Headquarters', 'April 2018', 'Argentina', 'Brazil', 'Chile', 'Colombia', 'Paraguay', 'Peru', 'August of the same year', 'Colombia', 'March 2019', 'Brazil', 'Jair Bolsonaro', 'March 13, 2019', 'Ecuador', 'Lenin Moreno', 'Quito', 'January 2019', 'Venezuela', 'Nicolas Maduro', 'PROSUR', 'Venezuela', 'Prosur', '22 March 2019', 'Venezuela', 'Argentina', 'Brazil', 'Bolivia', 'Colombia', 'Chile', 'Ecuador', 'Uruguay', 'Paraguay', 'Peru', 'Guyana', '10 March 2020']","['ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE']"

Because of seismic and volcanic activity associated with tectonic plate boundaries along the Pacific Ring of Fire, tsunamis occur most frequently in the Pacific Ocean, but are a worldwide natural phenomenon. They are possible wherever large bodies of water are found, including inland lakes, where they can be caused by landslides and glacier calving. Very small tsunamis, non-destructive and undetectable without specialized equipment, occur frequently as a result of minor earthquakes and other events.
Around 1600 BCE, a tsunami caused by the eruption of Thira devastated the Minoan civilization on Crete and related cultures in the Cyclades, as well as in areas on the Greek mainland facing the eruption, such as the Argolid.
The oldest recorded tsunami occurred in 479 BCE. It destroyed a Persian army that was attacking the town of Potidaea in Greece.As early as 426 BCE, the Greek historian Thucydides inquired in his book History of the Peloponnesian War (3.89.1–6) about the causes of tsunamis. He argued that such events could only be explained as a consequence of ocean earthquakes, and could see no other possible causes.","{3842, 7, 1170, 3989, 2169, 290, 2210, 4134, 1960, 4140, 2995, 1591, 4024, 311, 967, 1746, 595, 4307, 3927, 607, 608, 4971, 4589, 370, 889, 3322, 3451}",27,"['Sri Lanka', 'India', 'Indonesia', 'Thailand', 'Malaysia', 'Maldives', 'the Indian Ocean', 'the Pacific Ring of Fire', 'the Pacific Ocean', 'Minoan', 'Crete', 'Cyclades', 'Greek', 'Argolid', 'Persian', 'Potidaea', 'Greece', 'Greek', 'History of the Peloponnesian War']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'FAC', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'WORK_OF_ART']"

The program is currently hosted by Ryan Seacrest and presented as an adjunct to his weekday radio program, On Air with Ryan Seacrest.
Originally a production of Watermark Inc. (later a division of ABC Radio known as ABC Watermark, now Cumulus Media Networks), AT40 is now distributed by Premiere Networks (a division of iHeartMedia). Nearly 430 radio stations in the United States, and several other territories worldwide air AT40 making it one of the most listened-to weekly radio programs in the world. It can also be heard on iHeartRadio, TuneIn and the official AT40 applications on mobile smartphones and tablets as well as on Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 consoles (via iHeartRadio's console app) and the Armed Forces Network. GEICO is the main sponsor for the show.
Co-creator Casey Kasem hosted the original AT40 from its inauguration on July 4, 1970, until August 6, 1988. Shadoe Stevens took over the program on August 13, 1988, and hosted until January 28, 1995, when the original program came to an end. Three years later, Kasem teamed up with Premiere's predecessor AMFM Radio Networks to relaunch AT40. Kasem, who had spent nine years hosting his own countdown for Westwood One, returned to hosting his creation on March 28, 1998. Seacrest took over AT40 on January 10, 2004, following Kasem's retirement from the series.
Currently, AT40 with Seacrest airs in two different formats, with one distributed to Contemporary Hit Radio (Top 40) stations and the other to Hot Adult Contemporary stations. However, there is no distinction made between the two shows on air. There are also two classic editions of the original AT40 distributed every weekend, featuring past Kasem-hosted shows from the 1970s and 1980s.
In its early years, the AT40 used the Billboard charts to compile the countdown, touting it as ""the only source"". The program subsequently switched to being based on Radio and Records airplay data upon its late 1990s return. The current source for the AT40 charts are unpublished mainstream Top 40 and hot adult contemporary charts compiled by Mediabase.
Through most of the 1980s, the countdown was compiled by Stu Jacobs.

885,2004,May,6,"TV sitcom ""Friends"" airs season finale in 10th and final season in US (52.5 million viewers)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Guy,"Family Guy is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its surreal and dark humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.
The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series with one episode left unaired. Adult Swim aired that episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.
Since its debut on January 31, 1999, 344 episodes of Family Guy have been broadcast. Its eighteenth season began on September 29, 2019. The show has been widely acclaimed, prompting Family Guy to be nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since The Flintstones in 1961. Family Guy has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons to The Simpsons.
Many tie-in media have been released, including Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005; Family Guy: Live in Vegas, a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult based on the Family Guy universe; and Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy (2010), a series of parodies of the original Star Wars trilogy. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation.
A spin-off series, The Cleveland Show, featuring Cleveland Brown, aired from September 27, 2009, to May 19, 2013. ""The Simpsons Guy"", a crossover episode with The Simpsons, aired on September 28, 2014. Family Guy is a joint production by Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television. In 2013, TV Guide ranked Family Guy the ninth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.On February 12, 2019, Fox renewed the series for an eighteenth season, which premiered on September 29, 2019 on Animation Domination.","{1378, 4741}",2,"['US', 'Family Guy', 'American', 'Seth MacFarlane', 'the Fox Broadcasting Company', 'Griffins', 'Peter', 'Lois', 'Meg', 'Chris', 'Stewie', 'Brian', 'Quahog', 'Rhode Island', 'American', 'MacFarlane', 'The Life of Larry', 'Larry & Steve', 'MacFarlane', 'Larry', 'Steve', 'Peter', 'Brian', 'MacFarlane', 'Fox', '1998', 'the third season', 'Family Guy', '2002', 'Fox', 'Adult Swim', '2003', 'Adult Swim', '2004', 'a fourth season', 'May 1, 2005', 'January 31, 1999', 'Family Guy', 'Its eighteenth season began on September 29, 2019', 'Family Guy', 'Annie Awards', '2009', 'Flintstones', '1961', 'Family Guy', 'Simpsons', 'Stewie Griffin', 'The Untold Story', '2005', 'Family Guy', 'Vegas', '2005', 'MacFarlane', 'Walter Murphy', '2006', '2007', '2005', 'Harper Adult', 'Laugh It Up, Fuzzball:', '2010', 'Star Wars', '2008', 'MacFarlane', 'The Cleveland Show', 'Cleveland Brown', 'September 27, 2009', 'May 19, 2013', 'The Simpsons Guy""', 'Simpsons', 'September 28, 2014', 'Family Guy', 'Fuzzy Door Productions', '20th Century Fox Television', '2013', 'Family Guy', 'Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time', 'February 12, 2019', 'Fox', 'an eighteenth season', 'September 29, 2019', 'Animation Domination']","['GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG']"

Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy, where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch, and stand-up comedy, where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience. Sitcoms originated in radio, but today are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms.
A situational comedy television programme may be recorded in front of a studio audience, depending on the programme's production format. The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated or enhanced by the use of a laugh track. During filming productions, the laugh track is usually pre-recorded.Critics disagree over the utility of the term ""sitcom"" in classifying shows that have come into existence since the turn of the century. Many contemporary American sitcoms use the single-camera setup and do not feature a laugh track, thus often resembling the dramedy shows of the 1980s and 1990s rather than the traditional sitcom. Other topics of debate have included whether or not cartoons, such as The Simpsons or Family Guy, can be classified as sitcoms.","{4868, 1038, 5010, 663, 283, 1563, 2591, 4516, 1190, 1192, 1193, 1452, 1711, 4017, 2487, 3005, 2878, 1471, 576, 4287, 2372, 2504, 3656, 843, 2382, 4558, 2898, 1109, 4437, 2647, 3676, 3553, 2916, 3054, 1137, 1397, 1272, 767}",38,"['Frasier', 'NBC', 'U.S.', 'today', 'the turn of the century', 'American', 'the 1980s', '1990s']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE']"

Following the disappointing sales of their previous album Warning (2000), the band took a break before beginning their next album, Cigarettes and Valentines. The recording was cut short when the master tapes were stolen, and the band decided to start from scratch.
A concept album dubbed a ""punk rock opera"" by the band members, American Idiot follows the story of Jesus of Suburbia, a lower-middle-class American adolescent anti-hero. The album expresses the disillusionment and dissent of a generation that came of age in a period shaped by tumultuous events such as the Iraq War. Recording sessions were split between two California studios between 2003 and 2004.
American Idiot marked a career comeback for Green Day. It charted in 27 countries, peaking at number one in 19, and sold 16 million copies worldwide. The album spawned five successful singles: ""American Idiot"", ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"", ""Holiday"", ""Wake Me Up When September Ends"" and ""Jesus of Suburbia"".

The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete, some 600 more than expected, accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries. There were 301 medal events in 28 different sports. Athens 2004 marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance. 2004 also marked the return of the Olympic Games to the city where they began. Having previously hosted the Olympics in 1896, Athens became one of only four cities to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two separate occasions at the time (together with Paris, London, and Los Angeles).
A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games, replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since the 1928 Games. This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue. The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium. The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as ""unforgettable, dream games"" by IOC President Jacques Rogge, and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure, including a new airport, ring road, and subway system.
There have been arguments (mostly in popular media) regarding the cost of the 2004 Athens Summer Games and their possible contribution to the 2010-2018 Greek government-debt crisis, but there is little or no evidence for such a correlation.
The 2004 Olympics were generally deemed to be a success, with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world. The final medal tally was led by the United States, followed by China and Russia with the host Greece at 15th place.

891,2004,October,27,The Boston Red Sox win the World Series for the first time in 86 years,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox,"The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. They compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. The team have won nine World Series championships, tied for the third-most of any MLB team, and they have played in 14. Their most recent World Series appearance and win was in 2018. In addition, they won the 1904 American League pennant, but were not able to defend their 1903 World Series championship when the New York Giants refused to participate in the 1904 World Series. Founded in 1901 as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912. The ""Red Sox"" name was chosen by the team owner, John I. Taylor, circa 1908, following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the ""Boston Red Stockings"", including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves.
The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918. However, they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history, dubbed the ""Curse of the Bambino"" after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918, an 86-year wait before the team's sixth World Championship in 2004. The team's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history, including Enos Slaughter's ""mad dash"" in 1946, the ""Impossible Dream"" of 1967, Carlton Fisk's home run in 1975, and Bill Buckner's error in 1986. Following their victory in the 2018 World Series, they became the first team to win four World Series trophies in the 21st century, with championships in 2004, 2007, 2013 and 2018. The team's history has also been marked by the team's intense rivalry with the New York Yankees, arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports.The Boston Red Sox are owned by Fenway Sports Group, which also owns Liverpool F.C. of the Premier League in England. They are consistently one of the top MLB teams in average road attendance, while the small capacity of Fenway Park prevents them from leading in overall attendance. From May 15, 2003 to April 10, 2013, the Red Sox sold out every home game—a total of 820 games (794 regular season) for a major professional sports record. Both Neil Diamond's ""Sweet Caroline"", and The Standells's ""Dirty Water"" have become anthems for the Red Sox.",set(),0,"['The Boston Red Sox', 'the World Series', '86 years', 'The Boston Red Sox', 'American', 'Boston', 'Massachusetts', 'Major League Baseball', 'the American League (AL) East', 'World Series', 'World Series', '2018', '1904', 'American League', 'their 1903 World Series', 'the New York Giants', 'the 1904 World Series', '1901', ""the American League's"", ""the Red Sox'"", 'Fenway Park', '1912', 'The ""Red Sox""', 'John I.

898,2005,February,16,The Kyoto Protocol comes into force following its ratification by Russia.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol,"The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty which extends the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that commits state parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, based on the scientific consensus that (part one) global warming is occurring and (part two) it is extremely likely that human-made CO2 emissions have predominantly caused it. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005. There are currently 192 parties (Canada withdrew from the protocol, effective December 2012) to the Protocol.
The Kyoto Protocol implemented the objective of the UNFCCC to reduce the onset of global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to ""a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"" (Article 2). The Kyoto Protocol applies to the six greenhouse gases listed in Annex A: Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous oxide (N2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).The Protocol is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: it acknowledges that individual countries have different capabilities in combating climate change, owing to economic development, and therefore puts the obligation to reduce current emissions on developed countries on the basis that they are historically responsible for the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
The Protocol's first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012. All 36 countries that fully participated in the first commitment period complied with the Protocol. However, nine countries had to resort to the flexibility mechanisms by funding emission reductions in other countries because their national emissions were slightly greater than their targets. The financial crisis of 2007–08 helped reduce the emissions. The greatest emission reductions were seen in the former Eastern Bloc countries because the dissolution of the Soviet Union reduced their emissions in the early 1990s. Even though the 36 developed countries reduced their emissions, the global emissions increased by 32% from 1990 to 2010.A second commitment period was agreed in 2012, known as the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, in which 37 countries have binding targets: Australia, the European Union (and its 28 member states), Belarus, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and Ukraine. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine have stated that they may withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol or not put into legal force the Amendment with second round targets. Japan, New Zealand, and Russia have participated in Kyoto's first-round but have not taken on new targets in the second commitment period. Other developed countries without second-round targets are Canada (which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2012) and the United States (which has not ratified). As of February 2020, 137 states have accepted the Doha Amendment, while entry into force requires the acceptances of 144 states. Of the 37 countries with binding commitments, 7 have ratified.
Negotiations were held in the framework of the yearly UNFCCC Climate Change Conferences on measures to be taken after the second commitment period ends in 2020. This resulted in the 2015 adoption of the Paris Agreement, which is a separate instrument under the UNFCCC rather than an amendment of the Kyoto Protocol.",{4741},1,"['The Kyoto Protocol', 'Russia', 'The Kyoto Protocol', '1992', 'United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (', 'CO2', 'The Kyoto Protocol', 'Kyoto', 'Japan', '11 December 1997', '16 February 2005', 'Canada', 'December 2012', 'Protocol', 'The Kyoto Protocol', 'Article 2', 'The Kyoto Protocol', 'Annex', 'CO2', 'Methane', 'Sulphur', 'Protocol', 'Protocol', '2008', '2012', 'Protocol', 'Eastern Bloc', 'the Soviet Union', 'the early 1990s', '32%', '1990', '2012', 'the Doha Amendment', 'the Kyoto Protocol', 'Australia', 'the European Union', 'Belarus', 'Iceland', 'Kazakhstan', 'Liechtenstein', 'Norway', 'Switzerland', 'Ukraine', 'Belarus', 'Kazakhstan', 'Ukraine', 'the Kyoto Protocol', 'the Amendment', 'Japan', 'New Zealand', 'Russia', 'Kyoto', 'Canada', 'the Kyoto Protocol', '2012', 'the United States', 'February 2020', 'the Doha Amendment', '2020', '2015', 'the Paris Agreement', 'UNFCCC', 'the Kyoto Protocol']","['LAW', 'GPE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'LAW', 'LAW', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LAW', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'LAW']"
899,2005,February,26,"Hosni Mubarak, President of Egypt, orders the constitution changed to allow multi-candidate presidential elections, asking Egyptian parliament to amend Article 76",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_revolution_of_2011,"The Egyptian revolution of 2011, also known as the January 25 Revolution (Arabic: ثورة 25 يناير‎; Thawrah 25 yanāyir), started on 25 January 2011 and spread across Egypt. The date was set by various youth groups to coincide with the annual Egyptian ""Police holiday"" as a statement against increasing police brutality during the last  few years of Mubarak's presidency. It consisted of demonstrations, marches, occupations of plazas, non-violent civil resistance, acts of civil disobedience and strikes. Millions of protesters from a range of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Violent clashes between security forces and protesters resulted in at least 846 people killed and over 6,000 injured. Protesters retaliated by burning over 90 police stations across the country.The Egyptian protesters' grievances focused on legal and political issues, including police brutality, state-of-emergency laws, lack of political freedom, civil liberty, freedom of speech, corruption, high unemployment, food-price inflation and low wages. The protesters' primary demands were the end of the Mubarak regime and emergency law. Strikes by labour unions added to the pressure on government officials. During the uprising, the capital, Cairo, was described as ""a war zone"" and the port city of Suez saw frequent violent clashes. Protesters defied a government-imposed curfew, which was impossible to enforce by the police and military. Egypt's Central Security Forces, loyal to Mubarak, were gradually replaced by military troops. In the chaos, there was looting by rioters which was instigated (according to opposition sources) by plainclothes police officers. In response, watch groups were organized by civilian vigilantes to protect their neighborhoods.On 11 February 2011, Vice President Omar Suleiman announced that Mubarak resigned as president, turning power over to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF). The military junta, headed by effective head of state Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, announced on 13 February that the constitution is suspended, both houses of parliament dissolved and the military would govern for six months (until elections could be held). The previous cabinet, including Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik, would serve as a caretaker government until a new one was formed.After the revolution against Mubarak and a period of rule by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the Muslim Brotherhood took power in Egypt through a series of popular elections, with Egyptians electing Islamist Mohamed Morsi to the presidency in June 2012. However, the Morsi government encountered fierce opposition after his attempt to pass an Islamic-leaning constitution. Morsi also issued a temporary presidential decree that raised his decisions over judicial review to enable the passing of the constitution.

In the mid-1970s, Airbus conceived several derivatives of the A300, its first airliner, and developed the A330 twinjet in parallel with the A340 quadjet.
In June 1987, Airbus launched both designs with their first orders.
The A330-300, the first variant, took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered service with Air Inter in January 1994.
The slightly shorter A330-200 variant followed in 1998.
In 2014, Airbus launched the A330neo, re-engined with Trent 7000 turbofans, which entered service in November 2018.
The A330 shares its airframe with the early A340 variants, having two engines instead of four, two main landing gear legs instead of three, lower weights and slightly different lengths.
Both airliners have fly-by-wire controls, which was first introduced on the A320, as well as a similar glass cockpit.
The A330 was Airbus's first airliner to offer a choice of three engines: the General Electric CF6, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, or the Rolls-Royce Trent 700.
The A330-300 has a range of 11,750 km or 6,350 nmi with 277 passengers, while the shorter A330-200 can cover 13,450 km or 7,250 nmi with 247 passengers.
Later variants include the A330-200F dedicated freighter, the A330 MRTT military tanker, and the ACJ330 corporate jet.
The A330 MRTT was proposed as the EADS/Northrop Grumman KC-45 for the US Air Force's KC-X competition, but lost to the Boeing KC-46 in appeal after an initial win.
As of December 2019, A330 orders stand at 1,823 of which 1,492 have been delivered and 1,443 remain in operation.
Its largest operator is Turkish Airlines with 68 aircraft.
The A330 has allowed Airbus to expand its wide-body market share.
It competes with the Boeing 767 and smaller variants of the 777 and the 787.
It is complemented by the larger Airbus A350 XWB which succeeded the A340.",set(),0,"['Airbus', 'A380', 'Toulouse', 'France', 'Airbus', 'Airbus', 'the mid-1970s', 'Airbus', 'A300', 'A340', 'June 1987', 'Airbus', 'A330-300', 'November 1992', 'Air Inter', 'January 1994', '1998', '2014', 'Airbus', 'A330neo', 'Trent 7000', 'November 2018', 'A340', 'A320', 'Airbus', 'the General Electric CF6, Pratt & Whitney PW4000', 'the Rolls-Royce Trent 700', 'A330-300', 'nmi', 'nmi', 'the A330-200F', 'MRTT', 'MRTT', 'EADS', 'Northrop Grumman KC-45', ""the US Air Force's"", 'KC-X competition', 'Boeing', 'KC-46', 'December 2019', 'Turkish Airlines', 'Airbus', 'Boeing', '767', 'Airbus A350 XWB', 'A340']","['ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'PRODUCT', 'PRODUCT']"

They were timed to precede the G8 conference and summit held at the Gleneagles Hotel in Auchterarder, Scotland from 6–8 July 2005. Both events also coincided with the 20th anniversary of Live Aid. Run in support of the aims of the UK's Make Poverty History campaign and the Global Call for Action Against Poverty, ten simultaneous concerts were held on 2 July and one on 6 July. On 7 July, the G8 leaders pledged to double 2004 levels of aid to poor nations from US$25 billion to US$50 billion by the year 2010. Half of the money was to go to Africa.
More than 1,000 musicians performed at the concerts, which were broadcast on 182 television networks and 2,000 radio networks.
Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof announced the event on 31 May. Many former Live Aid acts offered their services to the cause. Prior to the official announcement of the event, many news sources referred to the event as Live Aid 2. However, Geldof and co-organiser Midge Ure have since explicitly said they do not think of the event as the same as Live Aid. On an episode of BBC Two music-based comedy panel show Never Mind the Buzzcocks, which aired on 2 March 2006, The Cribs frontman Ryan Jarman said he had texted Geldof to suggest that a ""Live Aid 2"" would be a good idea. However, after organising the event, Geldof said: ""This is not Live Aid 2. These concerts are the start point for The Long Walk To Justice, the one way we can all make our voices heard in unison."". Many of the Live 8 backers were also involved in the largely forgotten NetAid concerts, including Executive Producer Jeff Pollack.
Organisers of Live 8 presented the ""Live 8 List"" to the world leaders at the Live 8 call that politicians take action to ""Make Poverty History"". Names from the list also appeared on the giant televisions at each concert during the broadcast.
An official Live 8 DVD set was released on 7 November 2005 internationally and 8 November 2005 in the United States.

904,2005,July,28,The Provisional Irish Republican Army call an end to their thirty year long armed campaign in Northern Ireland,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army,"The Irish Republican Army (IRA; Irish: Óglaigh na hÉireann), also known as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provisional IRA or Provos), was an Irish republican paramilitary organisation that sought to end British rule in Northern Ireland, facilitate Irish reunification and bring about an independent republic encompassing all of Ireland. It was the most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles. It saw itself as the military force of an all-island Irish Republic, and as the sole legitimate successor to the original IRA from the Irish War of Independence. It accordingly referred to itself simply as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), or Óglaigh na hÉireann in Irish. It was designated a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland, both of whose authority it rejected.The Provisional IRA emerged in December 1969, following a split within the previous incarnation of the IRA and the broader Irish republican movement. It was the minority faction in the split, while the majority continued as the Official IRA. The term ""provisional"" was chosen to mirror the 1916 Provisional Government of the Irish Republic, and also to designate it as temporary pending reorganisation of the movement. Although this reorganisation eventually happened in 1970, the name stuck. The Troubles had begun shortly before when a largely Catholic, nonviolent civil rights campaign was met with violence from both Ulster loyalists and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), culminating in the August 1969 riots and deployment of British troops. The IRA initially focused on defence of Catholic areas, but it began an offensive campaign in 1971 (see timeline). The IRA's primary goal was to force the United Kingdom to negotiate a withdrawal from Northern Ireland. It used guerrilla tactics against the British Army and RUC in both rural and urban areas. It also carried out a bombing campaign in Northern Ireland and England against what it saw as political and economic targets.
The Provisional IRA called a final ceasefire in July 1997, after its political wing Sinn Féin was re-admitted into the Northern Ireland peace talks. It supported the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and in 2005 it disarmed under international supervision. An internal British Army document (released in 2007 under the Freedom of Information Act) examining its 37 years of deployment in Northern Ireland, described the IRA as ""a professional, dedicated, highly skilled and resilient force"", while loyalist paramilitaries and other republican groups were described as ""little more than a collection of gangsters"". US media usually described the IRA as ""activists"" and ""guerillas"", while the British press widely dubbed them ""terrorists"". Several splinter groups have been formed as a result of splits within the IRA, including the Continuity IRA (which formed in 1986 but did not become active until after the Provisional IRA ceasefire of 1994) and the Real IRA (after the final 1997 ceasefire), both of which are still active in the low-level dissident Irish republican campaign.
The IRA's armed campaign, primarily in Northern Ireland but also in England and mainland Europe, caused the deaths of over 1,700 people. The dead included around 1,000 members of the British security forces, and about 640 civilians. The IRA itself lost 275–300 members and an estimated 10,000 imprisoned at various times over the 30-year period.","{1378, 4741}",2,"['The Provisional Irish Republican Army', 'thirty year', 'Northern Ireland', 'The Irish Republican Army', 'Irish', 'hÉireann', 'the Provisional Irish Republican Army', 'Provos', 'Irish', 'republican', 'British', 'Northern Ireland', 'Irish', 'Ireland', 'republican', 'Troubles', 'Irish', 'the Irish War of Independence', 'the Irish Republican Army', 'Óglaigh na hÉireann', 'Irish', 'the United Kingdom', 'the Republic of Ireland', 'The Provisional IRA', 'December 1969', 'IRA', 'Irish', 'republican', 'the Official IRA', '1916', 'Provisional Government of the Irish Republic', '1970', 'Troubles', 'Catholic', 'Ulster', 'the Royal Ulster Constabulary', 'RUC', 'August 1969', 'British', 'IRA', 'Catholic', '1971', 'IRA', 'the United Kingdom', 'Northern Ireland', 'the British Army', 'RUC', 'Northern Ireland', 'England', 'July 1997', 'Sinn Féin', 'Northern Ireland', '1998', 'Good Friday Agreement', '2005', 'British Army', '2007', 'the Freedom of Information Act', '37 years', 'Northern Ireland', 'IRA', 'republican', 'US', 'IRA', 'British', 'IRA', 'the Continuity IRA', '1986', 'IRA', '1994', '1997', 'Irish', 'republican', 'IRA', 'Northern Ireland', 'England', 'Europe', 'British', 'IRA']","['ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PRODUCT', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'ORG']"

908,2005,November,22,Angela Merkel becomes the first female Chancellor of Germany,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel,"Angela Dorothea Merkel née Kasner; born 17 July 1954) is a German politician serving as the chancellor of Germany since 2005. She served as the leader of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 2000 to 2018. Merkel has been widely described as the de facto leader of the European Union, the most powerful woman in the world, and by some commentators as the ""leader of the free world"".Merkel was born in Hamburg in then-West Germany and moved to East Germany as an infant when her father, a Lutheran clergyman, received a pastorate in Perleberg. She obtained a doctorate in quantum chemistry in 1986 and worked as a research scientist until 1989. Merkel entered politics in the wake of the Revolutions of 1989, and briefly served as a deputy spokesperson for the first democratically elected East German Government headed by Lothar de Maizière in 1990. Following German reunification in 1990, Merkel was elected to the Bundestag for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and has been reelected ever since. As the protégée of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Merkel was appointed as the Federal Minister for Women and Youth in Kohl's government in 1991, and became the Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in 1994. After her party lost the federal election in 1998, Merkel was elected Secretary-General of the CDU before becoming the party's first female leader two years later in the aftermath of a donations scandal that toppled Wolfgang Schäuble.
Following the 2005 federal election, Merkel was appointed Germany's first female chancellor at the head of a grand coalition consisting of the CDU, its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In the 2009 federal election the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote, and Merkel was able to form a coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP). At the 2013 federal election, Merkel's CDU won a landslide victory with 41.5% of the vote and formed a second grand coalition with the SPD, after the FDP lost all of its representation in the Bundestag. After the 2017 federal election the CDU was again the largest party; she was reelected to her fourth term on 14 March 2018.In 2007, Merkel was President of the European Council and played a central role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Berlin Declaration. One of Merkel's consistent priorities has been to strengthen transatlantic economic relations. Merkel played a crucial role in managing the financial crisis at the European and international level, and she has been referred to as ""the decider"". In domestic policy, health care reform, problems concerning future energy development and more recently her government's approach to the ongoing migrant crisis have been major issues during her chancellorship.

913,2005,July,24,92nd Tour de France: no winner; Lance Armstrong retires after winning a record seventh consecutive victory but disqualified in 2012 for doping,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Armstrong,"Lance Edward Armstrong (born Lance Edward Gunderson; September 18, 1971) is an American former professional road racing cyclist, known for winning the Tour de France seven times before being disqualified over the biggest doping scandal in cycling history.
At age 16, Armstrong began competing as a triathlete and was a national sprint-course triathlon champion in 1989 and 1990. In 1992, Armstrong began his career as a professional cyclist with the Motorola team. He had notable success between 1993 and 1996 with the World Championship in 1993, the Clásica de San Sebastián in 1995, Tour DuPont in 1995 and 1996, and a handful of stage victories in Europe, including stage 8 of the 1993 Tour de France and stage 18 of the 1995 Tour de France. In 1996, he was diagnosed with a potentially fatal metastatic testicular cancer. After his recovery, he founded the Lance Armstrong Foundation (now the Livestrong Foundation) to assist other cancer survivors.
Returning to cycling in 1998, he was a member of the US Postal/Discovery team between 1998 and 2005, when he won his Tour de France titles, as well as a bronze medal in the 2000 Summer Olympics. Armstrong retired from racing at the end of the 2005 Tour de France, but returned to competitive cycling with the Astana team in January 2009, finishing third in the 2009 Tour de France later that year. Between 2010 and 2011, he raced with Team Radio Shack, the UCI ProTeam he helped found. He retired for a second time in 2011.
Armstrong became the subject of doping allegations after he won the 1999 Tour de France. For years, he denied involvement in doping. In 2012, a United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) investigation concluded that Armstrong had used performance-enhancing drugs over the course of his career and named him as the ringleader of ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen."" While maintaining his innocence, Armstrong chose not to contest the charges, citing the potential toll on his family. As a result, he was stripped of all of his achievements from August 1998 onward, including his seven Tour de France titles. He also received a lifetime ban from all sports that follow the World Anti-Doping Code, ending his competitive cycling career. The International Cycling Union (UCI) upheld USADA's decision and decided that his stripped wins would not be allocated to other riders. In January 2013, Armstrong publicly acknowledged his involvement in doping. In April 2018, Armstrong settled a civil lawsuit with the United States Department of Justice and agreed to pay US$5 million to the U.S. government after whistleblower proceedings were commenced by Floyd Landis, a former team member.",{1378},1,"['France', 'Lance Armstrong', '2012', 'Lance Edward Armstrong', 'Lance Edward Gunderson', 'September 18, 1971', 'American', 'age 16', 'Armstrong', '1989', '1990', '1992', 'Armstrong', 'Motorola', 'between 1993 and 1996', 'the World Championship', '1993', 'the Clásica de San Sebastián', '1995', 'Tour DuPont', '1995', '1996', 'Europe', '1993', 'Tour de France', '1995', 'Tour de France', '1996', 'the Lance Armstrong Foundation', 'the Livestrong Foundation', '1998', 'the US Postal/Discovery', 'between 1998 and 2005', 'Tour de France', 'the 2000', 'Summer Olympics', 'the end of the 2005', 'Tour de France', 'Astana', 'January 2009', '2009', 'Tour de France', 'later that year', 'Between 2010 and 2011', 'Team Radio Shack', 'the UCI ProTeam', '2011', 'Armstrong', '1999', 'Tour de France', 'years', '2012', 'a United States', 'USADA', 'Armstrong', 'Armstrong', 'August 1998', 'Tour de France', 'the World Anti-Doping Code', 'The International Cycling Union', 'UCI', 'USADA', 'January 2013', 'Armstrong', 'April 2018', 'Armstrong', 'the United States Department of Justice', 'U.S.', 'Floyd Landis']","['GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON']"

Juan Carlos is the grandson of Alfonso XIII, the last king of Spain before the abolition of the monarchy in 1931 and the subsequent declaration of the Second Spanish Republic. Juan Carlos was born in Rome, Italy, during his family's exile. Generalísimo Francisco Franco took over the government of Spain after his victory in the Spanish Civil War in 1939, yet in 1947 Spain's status as a monarchy was affirmed and a law was passed allowing Franco to choose his successor. Juan Carlos's father, Juan, was the third son of King Alfonso, who had renounced his claims to the throne in January 1941. Juan was seen by Franco to be too liberal and in 1969 was bypassed in favour of Juan Carlos as Franco's successor as head of state.Juan Carlos spent his early years in Italy and came to Spain in 1947 to continue his studies. After completing his secondary education in 1955, he began his military training and entered the General Military Academy at Zaragoza. Later, he attended the Naval Military School, the General Academy of the Air, and finished his tertiary education at the University of Madrid. In 1962, Juan Carlos married Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark in Athens. The couple had two daughters and a son together: Elena, Cristina, and Felipe. Due to Franco's declining health, Juan Carlos first began periodically acting as Spain's head of state in the summer of 1974. Franco died in November the following year and Juan Carlos became king on 22 November 1975, two days after Franco's death, the first reigning monarch since 1931; although his exiled father did not formally renounce his claims to the throne in favor of his son until 1977.
Expected to continue Franco's legacy, Juan Carlos, however, soon after his accession introduced reforms to dismantle the Francoist regime and begin the Spanish transition to democracy. This led to the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 in a referendum, which re-established a constitutional monarchy. In 1981, Juan Carlos played a major role in preventing a coup that attempted to revert Spain to Francoist government in the King's name. In 2008, he was considered the most popular leader in all Ibero-America. Hailed for his role in Spain's transition to democracy, the King and the monarchy's reputation began to suffer after controversies surrounding his family arose, exacerbated by an elephant-hunting trip he undertook during a time of financial crisis in Spain. In 2014, Juan Carlos, citing personal reasons, abdicated in favour of his son, who acceded to the throne as Felipe VI.","{2051, 7, 2568, 524, 20, 2590, 2078, 3110, 4134, 4138, 1583, 565, 4661, 58, 1090, 3154, 595, 3666, 2647, 4696, 2141, 606, 1633, 1634, 3581, 1133, 110, 1646, 1136, 2169, 2682, 127, 128, 1153, 4736, 1162, 3722, 4235, 1678, 144, 661, 1177, 158, 2721, 2210, 680, 1192, 3243, 174, 4785, 3252, 4276, 1724, 1730, 1732, 1222, 3272, 1739, 1742, 4307, 2262, 4824, 730, 3803, 4826, 1757, 4829, 1251, 3812, 3813, 2278, 2793, 234, 2794, 748, 4330, 3322, 3842, 1795, 1288, 3348, 278, 3862, 4889, 1309, 3874, 3365, 3382, 4407, 4924, 4413, 4430, 851, 2388, 2901, 3413, 4445, 1888, 1890, 873, 4971, 1388, 3436, 2415, 3951, 370, 4983, 4472, 889, 3451, 892, 3970, 387, 3459, 4489, 1419, 2955, 3979, 1934, 1424, 418, 2982, 2475, 4526, 2483, 4020, 4024, 4536, 1979, 3516, 5054, 3519, 3520, 3524, 453, 1990, 967, 2507, 4051, 5077, 982, 472, 2525, 990, 2018, 1508, 2026, 4589, 1526, 2039, 4605}",151,"['Irene Urdangarin', 'Juan Carlos I', 'Spain', 'Juan Carlos I', 'Spanish', 'xwaŋˈkaɾlos', 'Juan Carlos Alfonso', 'María de Borbón y Borbón', '5 January 1938', 'Spanish', 'Spain', 'November 1975', 'June 2014', 'Juan Carlos', 'Alfonso XIII', 'Spain', '1931', 'Juan Carlos', 'Rome', 'Italy', 'Generalísimo Francisco Franco', 'Spain', 'the Spanish Civil War', '1939', '1947', 'Spain', 'Franco', ""Juan Carlos's"", 'Juan', 'King Alfonso', 'January 1941', 'Juan', 'Franco', '1969', 'Juan Carlos', 'Franco', 'Juan Carlos', 'his early years', 'Italy', 'Spain', '1947', '1955', 'the General Military Academy', 'the Naval Military School', 'the General Academy of the Air', 'the University of Madrid', '1962', 'Juan Carlos', 'Sophia', 'Greece', 'Denmark', 'Athens', 'Elena', 'Cristina', 'Felipe', 'Franco', 'Juan Carlos', 'Spain', 'the summer of 1974', 'November the following year', 'Juan Carlos', '22 November 1975', 'two days', 'Franco', '1931', '1977', 'Franco', 'Juan Carlos', 'Francoist', 'Spanish', 'the Spanish Constitution', '1981', 'Juan Carlos', 'Spain', '2008', 'Ibero-America', 'Spain', 'Spain', '2014', 'Juan Carlos', 'Felipe VI']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG']"

918,2005,September,16,"Princess Jalilah bint Ali of Jordan, eldest child of Prince Ali bin Al Hussein and Rym Brahimi, born in Amman, Jordan",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_of_Jordan,"Hussein bin Talal (Arabic: الحسين بن طلال‎, Al-Ḥusayn ibn Ṭalāl; 14 November 1935 – 7 February 1999) reigned as King of Jordan from 11 August 1952 until his death in 1999. As a member of the Hashemite dynasty, the royal family of Jordan since 1921, Hussein claimed to be a 40th-generation direct descendant of Muhammad.
Hussein was born in Amman as the eldest child of Talal bin Abdullah and Zein Al-Sharaf. Hussein began his schooling in Amman, continuing his education abroad. After Talal became King of Jordan in 1951, Hussein was named heir apparent. The Parliament forced Talal to abdicate a year later due to his illness, and a regency council was appointed until Hussein came of age. He was enthroned at the age of 17 on 2 May 1953. Hussein was married four separate times and fathered eleven children: Princess Alia from Dina bint Abdul-Hamid; Abdullah II, Prince Faisal, Princess Aisha, and Princess Zein from Antoinette Gardiner; Princess Haya and Prince Ali from Alia Touqan; Prince Hamzah, Prince Hashim, Princess Iman, and Princess Raiyah from Lisa Halaby.
Hussein, a constitutional monarch, started his rule with what was termed a ""liberal experiment,"" allowing, in 1956, the formation of the only democratically elected government in Jordan's history. A few months into the experiment, he forced that government to resign, declaring martial law and banning political parties. Jordan fought three wars with Israel under Hussein, including the 1967 Six-Day War, which ended in Jordan's loss of the West Bank. In 1970 Hussein expelled Palestinian fighters (fedayeen) from Jordan after they had threatened the country's security in what became known as Black September. The King renounced Jordan's ties to the West Bank in 1988 after the Palestine Liberation Organization was recognized internationally as the sole representative of the Palestinians. He lifted martial law and reintroduced elections in 1989 when riots over price hikes spread in southern Jordan. In 1994 he became the second Arab head of state to sign a peace treaty with Israel.
At the time of Hussein's accession in 1953, Jordan was a young nation and controlled the West Bank. The country had few natural resources, and a large Palestinian refugee population as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Hussein led his country through four turbulent decades of the Arab–Israeli conflict and the Cold War, successfully balancing pressures from Arab nationalists, the Soviet Union, Western countries, and Israel, transforming Jordan by the end of his 46-year reign to a stable modern state. After 1967 he increasingly engaged in efforts to solve the Palestinian problem. He acted as a conciliatory intermediate between various Middle Eastern rivals, and came to be seen as the region's peacemaker. He was revered for pardoning political dissidents and opponents, and giving them senior posts in the government. Hussein, who survived dozens of assassination attempts and plots to overthrow him, was the region's longest-reigning leader. The King died at the age of 63 from cancer on 7 February 1999. His funeral was the largest gathering of world leaders since 1995. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Abdullah II.","{4097, 2051, 7, 2568, 524, 1555, 28, 4134, 2601, 1583, 2096, 563, 2104, 2119, 2122, 4682, 595, 1622, 2647, 2141, 2152, 1649, 628, 3190, 3702, 2169, 3195, 2684, 128, 640, 1153, 1162, 4235, 2191, 144, 2703, 3727, 1177, 666, 4768, 2721, 1192, 684, 3244, 174, 176, 4815, 3795, 4307, 1251, 2793, 2794, 1779, 3322, 3842, 1288, 2322, 3348, 4895, 290, 2851, 1828, 3874, 4905, 2355, 2875, 4413, 1860, 4430, 4942, 2388, 2901, 2391, 4445, 1888, 4971, 1388, 2415, 889, 890, 3451, 4993, 4994, 903, 2955, 3979, 3989, 5019, 418, 2475, 2483, 3508, 4020, 4024, 1979, 4539, 452, 964, 3524, 967, 4549, 2507, 3034, 2529, 1508, 2026, 4589, 5107, 2040, 4605}",110,"['Jalilah bint Ali', 'Jordan', 'Prince Ali bin Al Hussein', 'Rym Brahimi', 'Amman', 'Jordan', 'Hussein bin Talal', 'Arabic', 'Al-Ḥusayn ibn Ṭalāl', '14 November 1935', 'February 1999', 'King of Jordan', '11 August 1952', '1999', 'the Hashemite dynasty', 'Jordan', '1921', 'Hussein', 'Muhammad', 'Hussein', 'Amman', 'Talal bin Abdullah', 'Zein Al-Sharaf', 'Hussein', 'Amman', 'Talal', 'King of Jordan', '1951', 'Hussein', 'Parliament', 'Talal', 'a year later', 'Hussein', 'the age of 17', '2 May 1953', 'Hussein', 'Alia', 'Dina', 'bint Abdul-Hamid', 'Abdullah II', 'Prince Faisal', 'Aisha', 'Princess Zein', 'Antoinette Gardiner', 'Princess Haya', 'Prince Ali', 'Alia Touqan', 'Prince Hamzah', 'Prince Hashim', 'Iman', 'Raiyah', 'Lisa Halaby', 'Hussein', '1956', 'Jordan', 'A few months', 'Jordan', 'Israel', 'Hussein', 'the 1967 Six-Day War', 'Jordan', 'the West Bank', '1970', 'Hussein', 'Palestinian', 'Jordan', 'Black September', 'Jordan', 'the West Bank', '1988', 'the Palestine Liberation Organization', 'Palestinians', '1989', 'Jordan', '1994', 'Arab', 'Israel', 'Hussein', '1953', 'Jordan', 'the West Bank', 'Palestinian', '1948', 'Arab', 'Israeli', 'Hussein', 'Arab', 'Israeli', 'the Cold War', 'Arab', 'the Soviet Union', 'Israel', 'Jordan', '1967', 'Palestinian', 'Middle Eastern', 'Hussein', 'the age of 63', '7 February 1999', '1995', 'Abdullah II']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON']"

Henrik was born in the French commune of Talence near Bordeaux to an old French family, the Laborde de Monpezats. He spent his early years in Tonkin in French Indochina (now part of Vietnam), where his family had lived for many years. The family spent the Second World War at the family home in Cahors, France. They returned to French Indochina after the war. However, they were forced to flee following the defeat of the French in the First Indochina War. After completing his education in France and Vietnam, Henrik served in the French Army during the Algerian War. Prior to his marriage to Margrethe, he worked in the diplomatic service. He married Margrethe at the Holmen Church on 10 June 1967 and became her prince consort when she succeeded her father, King Frederick IX, as monarch of Denmark on 14 January 1972.He had two sons, Crown Prince Frederik (born 1968) and Prince Joachim (born 1969), and eight grandchildren. Throughout his time as Prince consort, Henrik voiced his displeasure with the fact that he never received the title of king.A keen winemaker, Henrik produced his own wine at his estate in France. He also published many works of poetry. He was the first male consort to a Danish monarch. Henrik retired from his royal duties on 1 January 2016, at the age of 81.

927,2006,October,4,"WikiLeaks is launched, created by internet activist Julian Assange",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange,"Julian Paul Assange (; né Hawkins; born 3 July 1971) is an Australian editor, publisher, and activist who founded WikiLeaks in 2006. WikiLeaks came to international attention in 2010 when it published a series of leaks provided by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Baghdad airstrike Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and Cablegate (November 2010). After the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks.In November 2010, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange, after questioning him months earlier about allegations of sexual assault. Assange denied the allegations, and said they were a pretext for him to be extradited from Sweden to the United States because of his role in publishing secret American documents. Assange surrendered to UK police on 7 December 2010, but was released on bail within ten days. Having been unsuccessful in his challenge to the extradition proceedings, he breached his £340,000 bail in June 2012 and took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London. He was granted asylum by Ecuador due to fears of political persecution and extradition to the United States. In January 2018, he was granted Ecuadorian citizenship, but this was suspended in 2019. Assange remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London for almost seven years.During the 2016 US Democratic Party presidential primaries, WikiLeaks hosted emails sent or received by candidate Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State. The U.S. Intelligence Community, as well as a Special Counsel investigation, concluded that the Russian government carried out a hacking campaign as part of broader efforts to interfere in the 2016 United States elections. In 2018, twelve Russian intelligence officers, mostly affiliated with the GRU, were indicted on criminal charges by Special Counsel Robert Mueller; the indictment charged the Russians with carrying out the computer hacking and working with WikiLeaks and other organisations to spread stolen documents. Assange has consistently denied any connection to or co-operation with Russia in relation to the leaks, and accused the Clinton campaign of stoking ""a neo-McCarthy hysteria"".On 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with the Ecuadorian authorities. The police were invited into the embassy, and he was arrested. Later that day, he was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act and on 1 May 2019 he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison in the United Kingdom. On the same day, the United States government unsealed an indictment against Assange for alleged computer intrusion, related to the leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. On 23 May 2019, the United States government further charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Editors from newspapers including The Washington Post and The New York Times criticised the government's decision to charge Assange under the Espionage Act. After having been dropped in 2017, Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation in May 2019, but in November closed it again, saying that the evidence had weakened over time. Assange is incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh, reportedly in ill health.",{4741},1,"['WikiLeaks', 'Julian Assange', 'Julian Paul Assange', '3 July 1971', 'Australian', 'WikiLeaks', '2006', 'WikiLeaks', '2010', 'U.S. Army', 'Chelsea Manning', 'Baghdad', 'Collateral Murder', 'April 2010', 'Afghanistan', 'July 2010', 'Iraq', 'October 2010', 'November 2010', '2010', 'United States', 'WikiLeaks', 'November 2010', 'Sweden', 'Assange', 'months earlier', 'Sweden', 'the United States', 'American', 'UK', '7 December 2010', 'ten days', 'June 2012', 'the Embassy of Ecuador', 'London', 'Ecuador', 'the United States', 'January 2018', 'Ecuadorian', '2019', 'the Embassy of Ecuador', 'London', 'almost seven years', '2016', 'US Democratic Party', 'WikiLeaks', 'Hillary Clinton', 'State', 'The U.S. Intelligence Community', 'Russian', '2016', 'United States', '2018', 'Russian', 'GRU', 'Robert Mueller', 'Russians', 'WikiLeaks', 'Russia', 'Clinton', 'neo-McCarthy hysteria""', '11 April 2019', 'Assange', 'Ecuadorian', 'Later that day', 'the Bail Act', '1 May 2019', '50 weeks', 'the United Kingdom', 'the same day', 'United States', 'Chelsea Manning', '23 May 2019', 'United States', 'the Espionage Act', '1917', 'The Washington Post', 'The New York Times', 'the Espionage Act', '2017', 'Swedish', 'May 2019', 'November', 'HM']","['ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE']"
928,2006,October,9,"North Korea conducts its first nuclear test, with an estimated yield of between 0.4-2 kilotons",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon_yield,"The explosive yield of a nuclear weapon is the amount of energy released when that particular nuclear weapon is detonated, usually expressed as a TNT equivalent (the standardized equivalent mass of trinitrotoluene which, if detonated, would produce the same energy discharge), either in kilotons (kt—thousands of tons of TNT), in megatons (Mt—millions of tons of TNT), or sometimes in terajoules (TJ).  An explosive yield of one terajoule is equal to 0.239 kilotonnes of TNT. Because the accuracy of any measurement of the energy released by TNT has always been problematic, the conventional definition is that one kiloton of TNT is held simply to be equivalent to 1012 calories.
The yield-to-weight ratio is the amount of weapon yield compared to the mass of the weapon. The practical maximum yield-to-weight ratio for fusion weapons (thermonuclear weapons) has been estimated to six megatons of TNT per metric ton of bomb mass (25 TJ/kg). Yields of 5.2 megatons/ton and higher have been reported for large weapons constructed for single-warhead use in the early 1960s. Since then, the smaller warheads needed to achieve the increased net damage efficiency (bomb damage/bomb mass) of multiple warhead systems have resulted in decreases in the yield/mass ratio for single modern warheads.","{4024, 2169, 4307, 2388}",4,"['North Korea', 'TNT', 'kt', 'TNT', 'TNT', 'TNT', 'TNT', 'TNT', '1012', 'TNT', 'the early 1960s']","['GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE']"
929,2006,December,6,NASA reveals photographs taken by Mars Global Surveyor suggesting the presence of liquid water on Mars,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars,"The possibility of life on Mars (or life on the closest planet to Earth) is a subject of huge interest in  astrobiology due to its proximity and similarities to Earth. To date, no proof has been found of past or present life on Mars. Cumulative evidence shows that during the ancient Noachian time period, the surface environment of Mars had liquid water and have been habitable for microorganisms. The existence of habitable conditions does not necessarily indicate the presence of life.Scientific searches for evidence of life began in the 19th century, and continue today via telescopic investigations and deployed probes. While early work focused on phenomenology and bordered on fantasy, the modern scientific inquiry has emphasized the search for water, chemical biosignatures in the soil and rocks at the planet's surface, and biomarker gases in the atmosphere.Mars is of particular interest for the study of the origins of life because of its similarity to the early Earth. This is especially so since Mars has a cold climate and lacks plate tectonics or continental drift, so has remained almost unchanged since the end of the Hesperian period. At least two thirds of Mars' surface is more than 3.5 billion years old, and Mars may thus hold the best record of the prebiotic conditions leading to life, even if life does not or has never existed there, which might have started developing as early as 4.48 billion years ago.Following the confirmation of the past existence of surface liquid water, the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers started searching for evidence of past life, including a past biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic, or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic compounds on Mars is now a primary NASA and ESA objective.
The findings of organic compounds inside sedimentary rocks and of boron on Mars are of interest as they are precursors for prebiotic chemistry. Such findings, along with previous discoveries that liquid water was clearly present on ancient Mars, further supports the possible early habitability of Gale Crater on Mars.  Currently, the surface of Mars is bathed with ionizing radiation, and Martian soil is rich in perchlorates toxic to microorganisms.  Therefore, the consensus is that if life exists —or existed— on Mars, it could be found or is best preserved in the subsurface, away from present-day harsh surface processes.
In June 2018, NASA announced the detection of seasonal variation of methane levels on Mars. Methane could be produced by microorganisms or by geological means. The European ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter started mapping the atmospheric methane in April 2018, and the 2022 ExoMars rover will drill and analyze subsurface samples, while the NASA Mars 2020 rover will cache dozens of drill samples for their potential transport to Earth laboratories in the late 2020s or 2030s.","{4480, 1153, 386, 3457, 1668, 1925, 6, 391, 1414, 3842, 1802, 523, 3970, 269, 2702, 5003, 1299, 2069, 3861, 1559, 4758, 4123, 4255, 2080, 2721, 2210, 4643, 1701, 3877, 4134, 2217, 3625, 1583, 2609, 2865, 188, 1343, 4800, 965, 967, 3528, 1865, 202, 2507, 1740, 4426, 4815, 2896, 3154, 595, 3666, 4307, 603, 1372, 861, 3036, 3167, 889, 3682, 3299, 1508, 4199, 3049, 4971, 1388, 3180, 4589, 2415, 1526, 504, 3833, 2558, 895}",73,"['NASA', 'Mars Global Surveyor', 'Mars', 'Mars', 'Earth', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Noachian', 'Mars', 'the 19th century', 'today', 'Mars', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Hesperian', 'Mars', 'Mars', 'Curiosity', 'Mars', 'NASA', 'ESA', 'Mars', 'Mars', 'Gale Crater on Mars', 'Mars', 'Martian', 'Mars', 'present-day', 'June 2018', 'NASA', 'Mars', 'The European ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter', 'April 2018', 'NASA', 'Mars', 'Earth', 'the late 2020s', '2030s']","['ORG', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'DATE']"

On 17 February 2012, Prince Friso was buried under an avalanche in Lech, Austria, while skiing off piste. He was taken to a hospital in Innsbruck, where he was in a critical but stable condition. According to his doctor, Wolfgang Koller, even though he was trapped for a relatively short time and hopes had originally been higher, subsequent neurological tests showed that after fifty minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in moderate hypothermia, he suffered massive brain damage due to oxygen shortage. His initial coma later progressed to a minimally conscious state, and it was unclear whether he would ever regain full consciousness.

She is the only woman in U.S. history to hold this position and is the highest-ranking female elected official in United States history. As House Speaker, Pelosi is second in the presidential line of succession, immediately after the vice president.Pelosi was first elected to Congress in 1987. She started her 17th term in 2019. She represents California's 12th congressional district, which consists of four-fifths of the city and county of San Francisco. She initially represented the 5th district (1987–1993), and then, when district boundaries were redrawn after the 1990 Census, the 8th district (1993–2013). She is a member of the Democratic Party. Pelosi has led House Democrats since 2003—being the first woman to lead a party in Congress—serving twice each as House minority leader (2003–2007 and 2011–2019, when Republicans held the majority), and as Speaker (2007–2011 and 2019–present, during periods of Democratic majority). 
Pelosi was a major opponent of the Iraq War as well as the Bush administration's 2005 attempt to partially privatize Social Security. During her first speakership, she was instrumental in the passage of many landmark bills, including the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and the 2010 Tax Relief Act.
Pelosi lost the speakership in January 2011 after the Democratic Party lost control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections. However, she retained her role as leader of the House Democratic Caucus and returned to the role of House minority leader. In the 2018 midterm elections, the Democrats won back control of the House. Afterward, when the 116th Congress convened on January 3, 2019, Pelosi was again elected speaker, becoming the first former speaker to return to the post since Sam Rayburn in 1955. Pelosi announced the commencement of impeachment hearings into President Donald Trump on September 24, 2019.","{4649, 367, 48, 4913, 5010, 4991}",6,"['The 110th United States Congress', 'Nancy Pelosi', 'the 1st', 'House', 'Nancy Patricia', ""D'Alesandro"", 'March 26, 1940', 'American', 'the United States', '2019', '2007', '2011', 'U.S.', 'United States', 'House', 'Pelosi', 'Pelosi', 'Congress', '1987', '2019', 'California', 'San Francisco', '1990', 'Census', 'the Democratic Party', 'Pelosi', 'House', 'Democrats', 'Congress', 'House', 'Republicans', 'Democratic', 'the Iraq War', 'Bush', '2005', 'Social Security', 'the Affordable Care Act', 'Dodd', '2010', 'Tax Relief Act', 'January 2011', 'the Democratic Party', 'the House of Representatives', '2010', 'the House Democratic Caucus', 'House', '2018', 'Democrats', 'House', 'the 116th Congress', 'January 3, 2019', 'Pelosi', 'Sam Rayburn', '1955', 'Pelosi', 'Donald Trump', 'September 24, 2019']","['ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"
940,2007,January,9,Apple Inc CEO Steve Jobs announces the iPhone,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs,"Steven Paul Jobs (; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. His declassified FBI report states that he used marijuana and LSD while he was in college, and once told a reporter that taking LSD was ""one of the two or three most important things"" he had done in his life.
Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple's members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated film Toy Story (1995).
Apple acquired NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few months. He was largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been at the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the ""Think different"" advertising campaign and leading to the iMac, iTunes, iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with a completely new Mac OS X, based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor at age 56 on October 5, 2011.","{2, 2051, 1795, 4611, 264, 2568, 2955, 3979, 4235, 1168, 1938, 531, 20, 1555, 1432, 152, 5022, 3998, 290, 2210, 4899, 1319, 1576, 4007, 5033, 3243, 2092, 3244, 4140, 1711, 4400, 177, 4526, 563, 2355, 2483, 4661, 311, 1591, 1847, 826, 1979, 5052, 4413, 1475, 3524, 1222, 968, 2507, 717, 4944, 1233, 2258, 595, 3154, 3413, 4307, 4056, 2171, 2141, 1374, 889, 608, 2018, 355, 5097, 874, 748, 1133, 370, 4981, 2169, 3322, 3451, 4605, 4990}",76,"['Apple Inc', 'Steve Jobs', 'iPhone', 'Steven Paul Jobs', 'February 24, 1955', 'October 5, 2011', 'American', 'Apple Inc.', 'Pixar', ""The Walt Disney Company's"", 'Pixar', 'NeXT', 'Jobs', '1970s', '1980s', 'Apple', 'Steve Wozniak', 'San Francisco', 'California', 'the San Francisco Bay Area', 'Reed College', '1972', 'India', '1974', 'Zen Buddhism', 'FBI', 'marijuana', 'LSD', 'Wozniak co-', 'Apple', '1976', 'Wozniak', 'Apple', 'a year later', 'the Apple II', 'the Xerox Alto', '1979', 'Apple Lisa', '1983', 'Macintosh', '1984', 'Macintosh', '1985', 'the Apple LaserWriter', 'Jobs', 'Apple', '1985', 'John Sculley', 'That same year', 'Jobs', 'Apple', 'NeXT', ""George Lucas's"", 'Lucasfilm', '1986', 'Pixar', '3D', 'Toy Story', '1995', 'Apple', 'NeXT', '1997', 'Jobs', 'a few months', 'Apple', 'Jony', '1997', 'iMac', 'iTunes', 'iPod', 'iPhone', 'App Store', 'iPad', '2001', 'Mac OS', 'Mac OS X', 'NeXT', 'Jobs', '2003', 'age 56', 'October 5, 2011']","['ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE']"
941,2007,May,8,A new Northern Ireland Executive is formed with Ian Paisley (Democratic Unionist Party) as First Minister and Martin McGuinness (Sinn Féin) as Deputy First Minister,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Paisley,"Ian Richard Kyle Paisley, Baron Bannside  (6 April 1926 – 12 September 2014), was a loyalist politician and Protestant religious leader from Northern Ireland.
He became a Protestant evangelical minister in 1946 and remained one for the rest of his life.  In 1951 he co-founded the fundamentalist Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster and was its leader until 2008. Paisley became known for his fiery sermons and regularly preached and protested against Roman Catholicism, ecumenism and homosexuality. He gained a large group of followers who were referred to as Paisleyites.
Paisley became involved in Ulster unionist/loyalist politics in the late 1950s.  In the mid-late 1960s, he led and instigated loyalist opposition to the Catholic civil rights movement in Northern Ireland. This contributed to the outbreak of the Troubles in the late 1960s, a conflict that would engulf Northern Ireland for the next thirty years. In 1970 he became Member of Parliament for North Antrim and the following year he founded the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which he would lead for almost forty years. In 1979 he became a Member of the European Parliament.
Throughout the Troubles, Paisley was seen as a firebrand and the face of hardline unionism. He opposed all attempts to resolve the conflict through power-sharing between unionists and Irish nationalists/republicans, and all attempts to involve the Republic of Ireland in Northern affairs. His efforts helped bring down the Sunningdale Agreement of 1974. He also opposed the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, with less success. His attempts to create a paramilitary movement culminated in Ulster Resistance. Paisley and his party also opposed the Northern Ireland peace process and Good Friday Agreement of 1998.
In 2005, Paisley's DUP became the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland, displacing the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), which had dominated unionist politics since 1905 and had been an instrumental party in the Good Friday Agreement. In 2007, following the St Andrews Agreement, the DUP finally agreed to share power with republican party Sinn Féin. Paisley and Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness became First Minister and deputy First Minister respectively in May 2007.

943,2007,October,2,President Roh Moo-hyun of South Korea walks across the Military Demarcation Line into North Korea on his way to the second Inter-Korean Summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea%E2%80%93South_Korea_relations,"North Korea–South Korea relations are the bilateral relations between North Korea and South Korea. Formerly a single nation that was annexed by Japan in 1910, the two nations have been divided since the end of World War II in 1945 and engaged in the Korean War from 1950–1953.  North Korea is an authoritarian one-party state Communist state run by the Kim dynasty. South Korea was formerly governed by one-party military dictatorships until 1987 when it held direct elections. Both nations claim the entire Korean peninsula and outlying islands. Both nations joined the United Nations in 1991 and are recognized by most member states. Since the 1970s, both nations have held informal diplomatic dialogues in order to ease military tensions. In 2000, President Kim Dae-jung became the first President of South Korea to visit North Korea, 55 years after the peninsula was divided.
Under President Kim, South Korea adopted the Sunshine Policy in pursuit of more peaceful relationships with North Korea. The policy established the Kaesong Industrial Region, among other things. This policy was continued by the next president Roh Moo-hyun who also visited North Korea in 2007 and met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. Through this meeting both leaders signed a declaration to pursue peace and recover inter-Korean relations. However, faced with growing criticism, the Sunshine Policy was discontinued under the next two governments. During Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-Hye's presidency, the relationship between North and South Korea became more hostile.
In 2018, beginning with North Korea's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics, the relationship has seen a major diplomatic breakthrough and become significantly warmer. In April 2018, the two countries signed the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula. In 2018, a majority of South Koreans approved the new relationship. The summits between North and South Korea have also facilitated positive relationships between North Korea and the United States. However, tensions between the two countries remain.","{640, 4993, 4994, 2051, 4871, 2955, 3979, 1678, 2703, 3727, 3989, 1177, 5019, 4895, 4768, 1185, 1058, 2339, 3490, 3874, 1832, 3752, 4905, 2475, 1709, 174, 815, 1584, 4526, 563, 2483, 4020, 4661, 2682, 2104, 4024, 698, 4536, 452, 3524, 4549, 586, 1739, 4430, 4051, 2004, 2388, 1622, 4307, 5077, 347, 3803, 2141, 4445, 1888, 1890, 3812, 3813, 2152, 4074, 4971, 620, 3564, 494, 1646, 4589, 1649, 2169, 3578, 3451, 4605, 127}",72,"['Roh Moo-hyun', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Inter-Korean Summit', 'North Korean', 'Kim Jong-il', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Japan', '1910', 'World War II', '1945', 'the Korean War', 'North Korea', 'Communist', 'the Kim dynasty', 'South Korea', '1987', 'Korean', 'the United Nations', '1991', 'the 1970s', '2000', 'Kim Dae-jung', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', '55 years', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'the Kaesong Industrial Region', 'Roh Moo-hyun', 'North Korea', '2007', 'North Korean', 'Kim Jong-il', 'inter-Korean', 'the Sunshine Policy', 'Lee Myung-bak', ""Park Geun-Hye's"", 'North and', 'South Korea', '2018', ""North Korea's"", '2018', 'Winter Olympics', 'April 2018', 'the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula', '2018', 'South Koreans', 'North and', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'the United States']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE']"

The show focuses on the personal and professional lives of the Kardashian–Jenner blended family. Its premise originated with Ryan Seacrest, who also serves as an executive producer. The series debuted on October 14, 2007, and has subsequently become one of the longest-running reality television series in the country. The eighteenth season premiered on March 26, 2020. Also, on February 27, Kris Jenner confirmed on the Ellen show that filming for season 19 has begun.
The series focuses mainly on sisters Kim, Kourtney, and Khloé and their half-sisters Kendall and Kylie. It also features their parents Kris and Caitlyn, and brother Rob. The significant others of the Kardashian sisters have also appeared on the show, including Kourtney's ex-boyfriend Scott Disick, Kim's ex-husband Kris Humphries, and current husband Kanye West, Khloé's ex-husband Lamar Odom, ex-boyfriend French Montana, and ex-boyfriend Tristan Thompson along with Rob's ex-girlfriend Adrienne Bailon and ex-fiancé Blac Chyna.

Kim's friend Jonathan Cheban and Khloé's friend Malika Haqq have also been part of the show.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians has been critically panned since its premiere. It is often criticized for the high degree of emphasis on the ""famous for being famous"" concept, and for appearing to fabricate some aspects of its storylines. Several critics also noted the show's lack of intelligence. However, some critics recognized the reality series as a ""guilty pleasure"" and acknowledged the family's success. Despite the negative reviews, Keeping Up with the Kardashians  has attracted high viewership ratings, becoming one of the network's most successful shows and winning several audience awards.
The series' success has led additionally to the creation of numerous spin-off series, including: Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Khloé & Lamar, Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons, Dash Dolls, Rob & Chyna, Life of Kylie, and Flip It Like Disick. The network has also broadcast several television specials featuring special events involving members of the family and friends.","{2052, 3083, 528, 3090, 3091, 1562, 1566, 551, 2090, 2092, 3630, 1584, 3632, 565, 1600, 66, 3139, 580, 1605, 2652, 4192, 97, 2152, 1133, 4718, 3186, 632, 3195, 2176, 1667, 4235, 144, 661, 154, 2213, 1711, 4785, 694, 703, 3777, 3268, 4807, 3804, 4829, 741, 748, 3308, 2798, 1783, 1272, 2297, 256, 771, 3332, 1307, 4895, 1319, 4905, 3371, 4400, 4913, 4407, 4413, 4437, 4438, 2417, 4978, 4990, 4991, 1929, 3468, 401, 5010, 403, 1464, 1979, 5059, 964, 4550, 5067, 1997, 4558, 1491, 3544, 3034, 492, 2555, 511}",88,"['Kardashians', 'Kim', 'Khloé', 'Kourtney Kardashian', 'US', 'Kardashians', 'KUWTK', 'American', 'Kardashian', 'Jenner', 'Ryan Seacrest', 'October 14, 2007', 'The eighteenth season', 'March 26, 2020', 'February 27', 'Kris Jenner', 'Ellen', 'season 19', 'Kim', 'Kourtney', 'Khloé', 'Kendall', 'Kylie', 'Kris', 'Caitlyn', 'Rob', 'Kardashian', 'Kourtney', 'Scott Disick', 'Kim', 'Kris Humphries', 'Kanye West', 'Khloé', 'Lamar Odom', 'French', 'Montana', 'Tristan Thompson', 'Rob', 'Adrienne Bailon', 'Blac Chyna', 'Caitlyn', 'Brody Jenner', 'season 1', 'Brandon', 'Brandon', 'Leah', 'Kim', 'Jonathan Cheban', 'Khloé', 'Malika Haqq', 'Kardashians', 'Kardashians', 'Kourtney', 'Kim Take', 'Miami', 'Kourtney', 'Kim', 'New York', 'Khloé & Lamar', 'Kourtney', 'Khloé Take The Hamptons', 'Rob & Chyna', 'Life of Kylie']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG']"

Born in Saint Michael and raised in Bridgetown, Barbados, Rihanna moved to the US in 2005, when she signed with Def Jam Recordings. She earned significant recognition following the release of her first two studio albums, Music of the Sun (2005) and A Girl like Me (2006), both of which were influenced by Caribbean music and peaked within the top ten of the US Billboard 200 chart. Rihanna's third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), incorporated more elements of dance-pop and catapulted her to greater stardom, establishing her status as a sex symbol and a leading figure in the music industry. Its international chart-topping single ""Umbrella"" earned Rihanna her first Grammy Award, winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.
Rihanna extended her fusion of pop, dance, and R&B on her next four studio albums, Rated R (2009), Loud (2010), Talk That Talk (2011), and the Grammy Award-winning Unapologetic (2012). All four releases incorporated experimentation of various musical styles and consolidated Rihanna's international chart success, Unapologetic being her first number-one album in the US. The records spawned a string of chart-topping singles, including ""Rude Boy"", ""Only Girl (In the World)"", ""What's My Name?"", ""S&M"", ""We Found Love"", ""Diamonds"", and ""Stay"". Her eighth studio album, Anti (2016), showcased her control over artistic creativity after her departure from Def Jam. It became her second US number-one album and featured the chart-topping single ""Work"". Besides solo materials, Rihanna has collaborated with recording artists such as Drake, Eminem, and Calvin Harris.
Having sold over 250 million records, Rihanna is one of the world's best-selling music artists. She has earned 14 number-one singles, 31 top-ten singles in the US, and 30 top-ten entries in the UK.

FTSE 100 had its biggest ever one-day points fall, European stocks closed with their worst result since 9/11, and Asian stocks drop as much as 15%.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_crash,"A stock market crash is a sudden dramatic decline of stock prices across a significant cross-section of a stock market, resulting in a significant loss of paper wealth. Crashes are driven by panic as much as by underlying economic factors. They often follow speculation and economic bubbles. 
A stock market crash is a social phenomenon where external economic events combine with crowd psychology in a positive feedback loop where selling by some market participants drives more market participants to sell. Generally speaking, crashes usually occur under the following conditions: a prolonged period of rising stock prices and excessive economic optimism, a market where price–earnings ratios exceed long-term averages, and extensive use of margin debt and leverage by market participants. Other aspects such as wars, large-corporation hacks, changes in federal laws and regulations, and natural disasters of highly economically productive areas may also influence a significant decline in the stock market value of a wide range of stocks. All such stock drops may result in the rise of stock prices for corporations competing against the affected corporations.There is no numerically specific definition of a stock market crash but the term commonly applies to steep double-digit percentage losses in a stock market index over a period of several days. Crashes are often distinguished from bear markets by panic selling and abrupt, dramatic price declines. Bear markets are periods of declining stock market prices that are measured in months or years. Crashes are often associated with bear  markets, however, they do not necessarily go hand in hand. Black Monday (1987), for example, did not lead to a bear market. Likewise, the Japanese bear market of the 1990s occurred over several years without any notable crashes.
Crashes are generally unexpected. As Niall Ferguson stated, ""Before the crash, our world seems almost stationary, deceptively so, balanced, at a set point. So that when the crash finally hits — as inevitably it will — everyone seems surprised. And our brains keep telling us it’s not time for a crash.""","{4611, 2051, 4101, 3598, 1555, 4642, 1573, 3109, 3110, 4134, 1583, 2096, 2122, 4682, 4174, 4688, 2141, 606, 607, 1633, 4199, 620, 1646, 2159, 1136, 1649, 2679, 2169, 2682, 127, 640, 1153, 3199, 1162, 3724, 1678, 2703, 3727, 1177, 2713, 4768, 1185, 2210, 680, 1710, 4799, 2760, 3272, 1739, 4815, 3795, 4307, 3799, 3803, 3812, 2278, 3303, 2793, 2794, 234, 748, 1780, 757, 3326, 1291, 1803, 1294, 3862, 4895, 290, 810, 812, 3886, 2875, 2368, 4426, 2891, 4430, 847, 4942, 1873, 3927, 4445, 1888, 3936, 1890, 870, 873, 3434, 1388, 2415, 1907, 4474, 3451, 892, 4993, 4994, 387, 4496, 3989, 3994, 3489, 418, 2984, 3501, 2483, 4024, 4539, 3524, 453, 4549, 967, 971, 2507, 4051, 5077, 1508, 4589, 5107, 1526, 3581}",121,"['Black Monday', 'FTSE 100', 'one-day', 'European', 'Asian', 'as much as 15%', 'several days', 'months', 'years', 'Crashes', 'Black Monday', 'Japanese', 'the 1990s', 'several years', 'Niall Ferguson']","['EVENT', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON']"
960,2008,February,24,Fidel Castro retires as the President of Cuba due to ill health after nearly fifty years,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_(decade),"The 2000s (pronounced ""two-thousands"") was a decade of the Gregorian calendar that began on January 1, 2000, and ended on December 31, 2009.  
The early part of the decade saw the long-time predicted breakthrough of economic giant China, which had double-digit growth during nearly the whole decade. To a lesser extent, India also benefited from an economic boom, which saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly dominant economic force. The rapid catching-up of emerging economies with developed countries sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in energy and food prices at the end of the decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with the crisis in housing and credit in the United States in late 2007 and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions. The outbreak of this global financial crisis sparked a global recession, beginning in the United States and affecting most of the industrialized world.
The growth of the Internet contributed to globalization during the decade, which allowed faster communication among people around the world; social networking sites arose as a new way for people to stay in touch no matter where they are, as long as they have an internet connection. The first social networking sites were Friendster, Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006, respectively. Myspace was the most popular social networking website until June 2009 when Facebook overtook Myspace in the number of American users. The E-mail continued to be popular throughout the decade and began to replace ""snail mail"" as the primary way of sending letters and other messages to people in far away locations, though it has been available since 1971.
The War on Terror and War in Afghanistan began after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The International Criminal Court was formed in 2002. A United States-led coalition invaded Iraq, and the Iraq War led to the end of Saddam Hussein's rule as Iraqi President and the Ba'ath Party in Iraq. Al-Qaeda and affiliated Islamist militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. The Second Congo War, the deadliest conflict since World War II, ended in July 2003. Further wars that ended included the Algerian Civil War, the Angolan Civil War, the Sierra Leone Civil War, the Second Liberian Civil War, the Nepalese Civil War, and the Sri Lankan Civil War. Wars that began included the conflict in the Niger Delta, the Houthi insurgency in Yemen, and the Mexican Drug War.
Climate change and global warming became household words in the 2000s. Predictions tools made significant progress during the decade, UN-sponsored organizations such as the IPCC gained influence, and studies such as the Stern report influenced public support for paying the political and economic costs of countering climate change. The global temperature kept climbing during the decade. In December 2009, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced that the 2000s may have been the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 have occurred in this decade. The WMO's findings were later echoed by the NASA and the NOAA.
Usage of computer-generated imagery became more widespread in films during the 2000s. December 2009's Avatar became the highest-grossing film for nearly a decade, before being overtaken by Avengers: Endgame in 2019. Documentary and mockumentary films, such as March of the Penguins and Super Size Me, were popular in the 2000s. 2004's Fahrenheit 9/11 by Michael Moore is the highest grossing documentary of all time. Online films became popular, and conversion to digital cinema started.  Video game consoles released in this decade included the PlayStation 2, the Xbox, the GameCube, the Wii, the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.",set(),0,"['Fidel Castro', 'Cuba', 'nearly fifty years', 'a decade', 'January 1, 2000', 'December 31, 2009', 'the decade', 'China', 'nearly the whole decade', 'India', 'the end of the decade', 'the latter third of the decade', 'the United States', 'late 2007', 'the United States', 'the decade', 'social networking', 'Friendster, Myspace, Facebook', 'Twitter', '2002', '2003', '2004', '2006', 'June 2009', 'Facebook', 'American', 'the decade', '1971', 'The War on Terror and War', 'Afghanistan', 'September 11', '2001', 'The International Criminal Court', '2002', 'United States', 'Iraq', 'the Iraq War', ""Saddam Hussein's"", 'Iraqi', ""the Ba'ath Party"", 'Iraq', 'Al-Qaeda', 'Islamist', 'the decade', 'The Second Congo War', 'World War II', 'July 2003', 'the Algerian Civil War', 'the Angolan Civil War', 'the Sierra Leone Civil War', 'the Second Liberian Civil War', 'the Nepalese Civil War', 'the Sri Lankan Civil War', 'the Niger Delta', 'Houthi', 'Yemen', 'the Mexican Drug War', 'the 2000s', 'the decade', 'UN', 'IPCC', 'Stern', 'the decade', 'December 2009', 'the World Meteorological Organization', 'the 2000s', 'the warmest decade', '1850', 'five warmest years', '1850', 'this decade', 'WMO', 'NASA', 'NOAA', 'the 2000s', ""December 2009's"", 'Avatar', 'nearly a decade', 'Avengers', '2019', 'March', 'the Penguins and Super Size Me', 'the 2000s', '2004', 'Michael Moore', 'this decade', 'the PlayStation 2', 'Xbox', 'GameCube', 'the PlayStation 3']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'PRODUCT']"

It is considered by many economists to have been the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.The crisis began in 2007 with a depreciation in the subprime mortgage market in the United States, and it developed into an international banking crisis with the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. Excessive risk-taking by banks such as Lehman Brothers helped to magnify the financial impact globally. Massive bail-outs of financial institutions and other palliative monetary and fiscal policies were employed to prevent a possible collapse of the world financial system. The crisis was nonetheless followed by a global economic downturn, the Great Recession. The Asian markets (China, Hong Kong, Japan, India, etc.) were immediately impacted and volatilized after the U.S. sub-prime crisis. The European debt crisis, a crisis in the banking system of the European countries using the euro, followed later.
In 2010, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted in the US following the crisis to ""promote the financial stability of the United States"".

966,2008,November,4,"Barack Obama becomes the first African-American to be elected President of the United States, defeating Republican candidate John McCain",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama,"Barack Hussein Obama II ( (listen); born August 4, 1961) is an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African-American president of the United States. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.
Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black person to head the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he represented the 13th district from 1997 until 2004 in the Illinois Senate, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate-primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after his presidential campaign began, and after close primary campaigns against Hillary Clinton. Obama was elected over Republican John McCain and was inaugurated alongside Joe Biden on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the ""Affordable Care Act"" or ""Obamacare""), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected Yemeni Al-Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki.
After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in Obergefell. He advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated three justices to the Supreme Court: Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while Merrick Garland faced partisan obstruction and was not confirmed. During his term in office, America's reputation abroad significantly improved.Obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public place him among the upper tier of American presidents. Obama left office in January 2017 but continues to reside in Washington, D.C.","{4097, 7, 2066, 3091, 1555, 1058, 4642, 1584, 2104, 4671, 2112, 1090, 4675, 580, 70, 583, 1622, 2150, 2152, 3693, 3199, 640, 130, 144, 1168, 666, 668, 2721, 3243, 3244, 1197, 174, 1709, 176, 1711, 4785, 2740, 703, 3777, 2241, 4307, 4829, 3813, 4330, 748, 1272, 3322, 3842, 1795, 1292, 4883, 4895, 1824, 4899, 805, 3882, 302, 2355, 2869, 4920, 2388, 3413, 4437, 4445, 1888, 874, 4971, 3437, 367, 4472, 889, 4993, 4994, 3459, 900, 3978, 2955, 3979, 2964, 3989, 2475, 3500, 5037, 1967, 1979, 452, 964, 3524, 2508, 1997, 4558, 463, 4051, 2004, 5077, 4589, 3578, 2555, 4605}",99,"['African-American', 'the United States', 'Republican', 'John McCain', 'Barack Hussein', 'August 4, 1961', 'American', 'the United States', '2009 to 2017', 'the Democratic Party', 'African-American', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'Illinois', '2005', '2008', 'Illinois', '1997', '2004', 'Honolulu', 'Hawaii', 'Columbia University', '1983', 'Chicago', '1988', 'Harvard Law School', 'the Harvard Law Review', 'the University of Chicago Law School', '1992', '2004', '1997', '2004', 'the Illinois Senate', 'the U.S. Senate', '2004', 'March', 'Senate', 'July', 'November', 'Senate', '2008', 'a year', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Obama', 'Republican', 'John McCain', 'Joe Biden', 'January 20, 2009', 'Nine months later', '2009', 'Nobel Peace Prize', 'his first two years', 'the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act', 'the ""Affordable Care Act', 'Obamacare', 'Dodd', '2010', 'The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', '2009', 'Job Creation Act', '2010', 'the Great Recession', 'the Budget Control', 'the American Taxpayer Relief Acts', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'the United States', 'Russia New START', 'the Iraq War', 'Libya', 'Muammar Gaddafi', 'Osama bin Laden', 'Yemeni', 'Al-Qaeda', 'Anwar al-Awlaki', 'Republican', 'Mitt Romney', 'Obama', '2013', 'Americans', 'the Supreme Court', 'United States', 'Obergefell v.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures, it is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was directed by Jon Favreau from a screenplay by the writing teams of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, and stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub, and Gwyneth Paltrow. In the film, Tony Stark is an industrialist and master engineer who builds a mechanized suit of armor and becomes the superhero Iron Man.
A film featuring the character was in development at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and New Line Cinema at various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2006. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other superhero stories that are set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armor, created by Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title character.
Iron Man premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 2, as the first film in Phase One of the MCU. It grossed over $585 million on its $140 million budget, becoming the eighth-highest grossing film of 2008. The film was praised by critics for its acting (particularly Downey's), screenplay, direction, visual effects, and action sequences. It was selected by the American Film Institute as one of the ten best films of 2008 and received two nominations at the 81st Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. It was followed by two sequels, Iron Man 2 in 2010 and Iron Man 3 in 2013.","{4611, 1539, 7, 2568, 4115, 34, 1058, 3621, 1576, 4140, 1584, 565, 2104, 4671, 4675, 580, 3151, 4688, 1622, 612, 3686, 2152, 1649, 2169, 640, 2703, 3727, 4768, 4785, 694, 703, 3777, 1222, 1742, 1235, 4307, 4824, 4825, 4829, 4330, 748, 1272, 3322, 3842, 1795, 4895, 1319, 3371, 4400, 826, 4923, 4430, 2388, 4437, 3927, 4445, 3427, 4971, 4472, 889, 3451, 4992, 4993, 4994, 3459, 900, 903, 2955, 3979, 2964, 1432, 4007, 424, 1455, 948, 1464, 4024, 452, 964, 4549, 1997, 4558, 4563, 2004, 5077, 4056, 5088, 2529, 4589, 3578, 4605}",91,"['the Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'Iron Man', 'Jon Favreau', 'Robert Downey Jr.', 'Tony Stark', 'Iron Man', '2008', 'American', 'Marvel Studios', 'Paramount Pictures', 'the Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'Jon Favreau', 'Mark Fergus', 'Hawk Ostby', 'Art Marcum', 'Matt Holloway', 'Robert Downey Jr.', 'Tony Stark / Iron', 'Terrence Howard', 'Jeff Bridges', 'Gwyneth Paltrow', 'Tony Stark', 'Iron Man', 'Universal Pictures', '20th Century Fox', 'New Line Cinema', '1990', 'Marvel Studios', '2006', 'Paramount Pictures', 'Favreau', 'April 2006', 'September', 'March to June 2007', 'California', 'New York City', ""Stan Winston's"", 'Sydney', 'April 14, 2008', 'the United States', 'May 2', 'MCU', '2008', 'Downey', 'the American Film Institute', '2008', 'the 81st Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects', 'Iron Man 2', '2010', 'Iron Man 3', '2013']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE']"

972,2008,April,20,Danica Patrick driving for Andretti Green Racing wins the Indy Japan 300 at Twin Ring Motegi; first female driver in history to win an IndyCar Series race,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danica_Patrick,"Danica Sue Patrick (; born March 25, 1982) is an American former professional racing driver. She is the most successful woman in the history of American open-wheel racing—her victory in the 2008 Indy Japan 300 is the only win by a woman in an IndyCar Series race.
Born to a working-class family in Beloit, Wisconsin, Patrick began karting at the age of ten and achieved early success by winning her class in the World Karting Association Grand National Championship three times in the mid-1990s. She dropped out of high school with her parents' permission in 1998, and moved to the United Kingdom to further her career. Patrick competed in Formula Vauxhall and Formula Ford before returning to the United States in 2001 due to a lack of funding. In 2002, she competed in five Barber Dodge Pro Series races for Rahal Letterman Racing. Patrick later raced in the Toyota Atlantic Series for the next two years. Her best effort was third in the championship standings for the 2004 season where she became the first woman to win a pole position in the series.
She first drove in the IndyCar Series with Rahal Letterman Racing in 2005 and took three pole positions, equaling Tomas Scheckter's record of poles in a rookie season. She was named the Rookie of the Year for both the 2005 Indianapolis 500 and the 2005 IndyCar Series. She improved over the next two years with Rahal Letterman Racing in 2006 and later Andretti Green Racing in 2007. In 2008, Patrick followed up this victory to place sixth overall in the drivers' standings. She improved on this to secure fifth the following season, which saw her finish a career-high third at the Indianapolis 500, the best performance by any woman at the race. Patrick's overall form declined during 2010, but she still managed two second-places at oval tracks before leaving IndyCar after the 2011 season to focus on stock car racing full-time.
Patrick began racing stock cars in 2010 in the NASCAR Nationwide Series (now Xfinity Series) with her best result coming in the form of a fourth-place finish at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in 2011. She placed a career-high tenth in the 2012 season standings and was the second woman to clinch a pole position in the Nationwide Series after Shawna Robinson in 1994. Patrick started in the Sprint Cup Series (now NASCAR Cup Series) in 2012. She became the first woman to win a Cup Series pole position by setting the fastest qualifying lap for the 2013 Daytona 500, finishing eighth. Patrick bested Janet Guthrie's record for the most top-ten finishes by a woman in the Sprint Cup Series in 2015. She stopped racing full-time after the 2017 season, but competed at the 2018 Daytona 500 and the 2018 Indianapolis 500 before officially retiring.","{3332, 4235, 3468, 5010, 3091, 663, 793, 2717, 4516, 3243, 4140, 4526, 1711, 4400, 4661, 2487, 1979, 4413, 4287, 2112, 4675, 580, 3399, 460, 4558, 4561, 3413, 4437, 3676, 1890, 1251, 3814, 2793, 2417, 2039, 1272, 3578, 2171, 4990}",39,"['Danica Patrick', 'Andretti Green Racing', 'Twin Ring Motegi', 'IndyCar Series', 'Danica Sue Patrick', 'March 25, 1982', 'American', 'American', '2008', 'Indy Japan', 'IndyCar Series', 'Beloit', 'Wisconsin', 'Patrick', 'the age of ten', 'the World Karting Association Grand National', 'the mid-1990s', '1998', 'the United Kingdom', 'Patrick', 'Formula Vauxhall', 'Formula Ford', 'the United States', '2001', '2002', 'Barber Dodge', 'Rahal Letterman Racing', 'Patrick', 'the Toyota Atlantic Series', 'the next two years', 'the 2004 season', 'the IndyCar Series', 'Rahal Letterman Racing', '2005', ""Tomas Scheckter's"", 'a rookie season', 'the Rookie of the Year', '2005', 'Indianapolis 500', '2005', 'IndyCar Series', 'the next two years', 'Rahal Letterman Racing', '2006', '2007', '2008', 'Patrick', 'the following season', 'the Indianapolis 500', 'Patrick', '2010', 'IndyCar', 'the 2011 season', 'Patrick', '2010', 'the NASCAR Nationwide Series', 'Xfinity Series', 'Las Vegas Motor Speedway', '2011', '2012', 'the Nationwide Series', '1994', 'Patrick', 'the Sprint Cup Series', 'NASCAR Cup Series', '2012', 'Cup Series', '2013', 'Daytona 500', 'Patrick', ""Janet Guthrie's"", 'the Sprint Cup Series', '2015', 'the 2017 season', '2018', 'Daytona 500']","['PERSON', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT']"

Turning to elective politics, he represented the 13th district from 1997 until 2004 in the Illinois Senate, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate-primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after his presidential campaign began, and after close primary campaigns against Hillary Clinton. Obama was elected over Republican John McCain and was inaugurated alongside Joe Biden on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the ""Affordable Care Act"" or ""Obamacare""), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected Yemeni Al-Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki.
After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in Obergefell. He advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated three justices to the Supreme Court: Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while Merrick Garland faced partisan obstruction and was not confirmed. During his term in office, America's reputation abroad significantly improved.Obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public place him among the upper tier of American presidents. Obama left office in January 2017 but continues to reside in Washington, D.C.","{640, 1025, 3970, 2051, 4097, 4736, 1678, 2702, 1938, 3348, 3862, 1432, 3869, 4768, 2337, 290, 2721, 1828, 2342, 4007, 4134, 4775, 1834, 1967, 690, 2483, 4020, 949, 1847, 4024, 826, 4539, 4549, 1990, 967, 457, 202, 971, 1739, 2122, 2507, 4426, 4430, 4682, 4815, 595, 981, 3542, 4824, 4825, 5080, 3803, 2141, 1890, 2018, 3812, 5092, 358, 870, 3686, 635, 1642, 1388, 3180, 1646, 3951, 1136, 4722, 2169, 4474, 3451, 4986}",72,"['Barack Obama', 'the United States of America', ""the United States'"", 'African-American', 'Barack Hussein', 'August 4, 1961', 'American', 'the United States', '2009 to 2017', 'the Democratic Party', 'African-American', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'Illinois', '2005', '2008', 'Illinois', '1997', '2004', 'Honolulu', 'Hawaii', 'Columbia University', '1983', 'Chicago', '1988', 'Harvard Law School', 'the Harvard Law Review', 'the University of Chicago Law School', '1992', '2004', '1997', '2004', 'the Illinois Senate', 'the U.S. Senate', '2004', 'March', 'Senate', 'July', 'November', 'Senate', '2008', 'a year', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Obama', 'Republican', 'John McCain', 'Joe Biden', 'January 20, 2009', 'Nine months later', '2009', 'Nobel Peace Prize', 'his first two years', 'the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act', 'the ""Affordable Care Act', 'Obamacare', 'Dodd', '2010', 'The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', '2009', 'Job Creation Act', '2010', 'the Great Recession', 'the Budget Control', 'the American Taxpayer Relief Acts', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'the United States', 'Russia New START', 'the Iraq War', 'Libya', 'Muammar Gaddafi', 'Osama bin Laden', 'Yemeni', 'Al-Qaeda', 'Anwar al-Awlaki', 'Republican', 'Mitt Romney', 'Obama', '2013', 'Americans', 'the Supreme Court', 'United States', 'Obergefell v.

987,2009,April,30,Chrysler automobile company files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler,"Chrysler (; officially FCA US LLC, the first acronym standing for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) is one of the ""Big Three"" automobile manufacturers in the United States, headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The original Chrysler Corporation was founded in 1925 by Walter Chrysler from the remains of the Maxwell Motor Company. In 1998, it was acquired by Daimler-Benz, and the holding company was renamed DaimlerChrysler. After Daimler divested Chrysler in 2007, the company existed as Chrysler LLC (2007–2009) and Chrysler Group LLC (2009–2014) before merging in 2014 with Italian holding company Fiat S.p.A. and becoming a subsidiary of its successor Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. In addition to the Chrysler brand, FCA sells vehicles worldwide under the Dodge, Jeep, and Ram nameplates. Furthermore, the subsidiary includes Mopar, its automotive parts and accessories division, and SRT, its performance automobile division.
After founding the company, Walter Chrysler used the General Motors brand diversification and hierarchy strategy that he had seen working for Buick, and acquired Fargo Trucks and Dodge Brothers, and created the Plymouth and DeSoto brands in 1928. Facing postwar declines in market share, productivity, and profitability, as GM and Ford were growing, Chrysler borrowed $250 million in 1954 from Prudential Insurance to pay for expansion and updated car designs.Chrysler expanded into Europe by taking control of French, British and Spanish auto companies in the 1960s; Chrysler Europe was sold in 1978 to PSA Peugeot Citroën for $1. The company struggled to adapt to changing markets, increased U.S. import competition, and safety and environmental regulation in the 1970s. It began an engineering partnership with Mitsubishi Motors, and began selling Mitsubishi vehicles branded as Dodge and Plymouth in North America. On the verge of bankruptcy in the late 1970s, it was saved by $1.5 billion in loan guarantees from the U.S. government. New CEO Lee Iacocca was credited with returning the company to profitability in the 1980s. In 1985, Diamond-Star Motors was created, further expanding the Chrysler-Mitsubishi relationship. In 1987, Chrysler acquired American Motors Corporation (AMC), which brought the profitable Jeep brand under the Chrysler umbrella. In 1998, Chrysler merged with German automaker Daimler-Benz to form DaimlerChrysler AG; the merger proved contentious with investors. As a result, Chrysler was sold to Cerberus Capital Management and renamed Chrysler LLC in 2007.
Like the other Big Three automobile manufacturers, Chrysler was impacted by the automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010. The company remained in business through a combination of negotiations with creditors, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on April 30, 2009, and participating in a bailout from the U.S. government through the Troubled Asset Relief Program. On June 10, 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat S.p.A., and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. The bankruptcy resulted in Chrysler defaulting on over $4 billion in debts. By May 24, 2011, Chrysler finished repaying its obligations to the U.S. government five years early, although the cost to the American taxpayer was $1.3 billion. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares while removing much of the weight of the loans (which carried a 21% interest rate) in a short period.
On January 1, 2014, Fiat S.p.A announced a deal to purchase the rest of Chrysler from the United Auto Workers retiree health trust. The deal was completed on January 21, 2014, making Chrysler Group a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. In May 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles was established by merging Fiat S.p.A. into the company. This was completed in August 2014. Chrysler Group LLC remained a subsidiary until December 15, 2014, when it was renamed FCA US LLC, to reflect the Fiat-Chrysler merger.","{640, 4993, 4994, 1795, 900, 4101, 7, 2955, 2703, 1808, 4113, 1275, 3989, 2040, 1177, 2078, 294, 4775, 2170, 2601, 1712, 2104, 4024, 4536, 4920, 3903, 4671, 586, 3322, 2508, 4942, 4688, 4051, 2388, 3285, 982, 1622, 2262, 5079, 987, 3163, 2141, 1502, 3805, 3808, 4445, 3303, 4330, 619, 620, 3693, 1646, 4589, 1649, 5107, 4472, 2169, 2682, 3451, 4605, 127}",61,"['Chrysler', 'Chapter 11', 'Chrysler', 'US', 'Fiat Chrysler Automobiles', 'the ""Big Three""', 'the United States', 'Auburn Hills', 'Michigan', 'Chrysler Corporation', '1925', 'Walter Chrysler', 'the Maxwell Motor Company', '1998', 'Daimler-Benz', 'DaimlerChrysler', 'Daimler', 'Chrysler', '2007', 'Chrysler', 'Chrysler Group', '2014', 'Italian', 'Fiat S.p.A.', 'Fiat Chrysler Automobiles', 'Chrysler', 'FCA', 'Dodge', 'Jeep', 'Ram', 'Mopar', 'SRT', 'Walter Chrysler', 'General Motors', 'Buick', 'Fargo Trucks', 'Dodge Brothers', 'Plymouth', 'DeSoto', '1928', 'GM', 'Ford', 'Chrysler', '1954', 'Prudential Insurance', 'Chrysler', 'Europe', 'French', 'British', 'Spanish', 'the 1960s', 'Chrysler Europe', '1978', 'PSA Peugeot Citroën', 'U.S.', 'the 1970s', 'Mitsubishi Motors', 'Mitsubishi', 'Dodge', 'Plymouth', 'North America', 'the late 1970s', 'U.S.', 'Lee Iacocca', 'the 1980s', '1985', 'Diamond-Star Motors', 'Chrysler', '1987', 'Chrysler', 'American Motors Corporation', 'AMC', 'Jeep', 'Chrysler', '1998', 'Chrysler', 'German', 'Daimler-Benz', 'DaimlerChrysler AG', 'Chrysler', 'Cerberus Capital Management', 'Chrysler', '2007', 'Chrysler', 'Chapter 11', 'April 30, 2009', 'U.S.', 'June 10, 2009', 'Chrysler', 'the United Auto Workers', 'Fiat S.p.A.', 'U.S.', 'Canadian', 'Chrysler', 'May 24, 2011', 'Chrysler', 'U.S.', 'five years early', 'American', 'the next few years', 'Fiat', '21%', 'January 1, 2014', 'Fiat S.p', 'Chrysler', 'the United Auto Workers', 'January 21, 2014', 'Chrysler Group', 'Fiat S.p.A.', 'May 2014', 'Fiat Chrysler Automobiles', 'Fiat S.p.A.', 'August 2014', 'Chrysler Group LLC', 'December 15, 2014', 'FCA US LLC', 'Fiat-Chrysler']","['ORG', 'LAW', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG']"
988,2009,May,18,"Sri Lankan Civil War: The LTTE are defeated by the Sri Lankan government, ending almost 26 years of fighting between the two sides.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War,"The Sri Lankan Civil War (Sinhala: ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ සිවිල් යුද්ධය; Tamil: ஈழப் போர்) was a civil war fought in the island country of Sri Lanka from 1983 to 2009. Beginning on 23 July 1983, there was an intermittent insurgency against the government by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (the LTTE, also known as the Tamil Tigers), which fought to create an independent Tamil state called Tamil Eelam in the north and the east of the island. After a 26-year military campaign, the Sri Lankan military defeated the Tamil Tigers in May 2009, bringing the civil war to an end.For over 25 years, the war caused significant hardships for the population, environment and the economy of the country, with an initial estimated 80,000–100,000 people killed during its course. In 2013, the UN panel estimated additional deaths during the last phase of the war: ""Around 40,000 died while other independent reports estimated the number of civilians dead to exceed 100,000."" During the early part of the conflict, the Sri Lankan forces attempted to retake the areas captured by the LTTE. The tactics employed by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam against the actions of Government forces resulted in their listing as a terrorist organisation in 32 countries, including the United States, India, Canada and the member nations of the European Union. The Sri Lankan government forces have also been accused of human rights abuses, systematic impunity for serious human rights violations, lack of respect for habeas corpus in arbitrary detentions, and forced disappearances.After two decades of fighting and four failed tries at peace talks, including the unsuccessful deployment of the Indian Army, the Indian Peace Keeping Force from 1987 to 1990, a lasting negotiated settlement to the conflict appeared possible when a cease-fire was declared in December 2001, and a ceasefire agreement signed with international mediation in 2002. However, limited hostilities renewed in late 2005 and the conflict began to escalate until the government launched a number of major military offensives against the LTTE beginning in July 2006, driving the LTTE out of the entire Eastern province of the island. The LTTE then declared they would ""resume their freedom struggle to achieve statehood"".In 2007, the government shifted its offensive to the north of the country, and formally announced its withdrawal from the ceasefire agreement on 2 January 2008, alleging that the LTTE violated the agreement over 10,000 times. Since then, aided by the destruction of a number of large arms smuggling vessels that belonged to the LTTE, and an international crackdown on the funding for the Tamil Tigers, the government took control of the entire area previously controlled by the Tamil Tigers, including their de facto capital Kilinochchi, main military base Mullaitivu and the entire A9 highway, leading the LTTE to finally admit defeat on 17 May 2009.  Following the LTTE's defeat, pro-LTTE Tamil National Alliance dropped its demand for a separate state, in favour of a federal solution. In May 2010, Mahinda Rajapaksa, the then president of Sri Lanka, appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to assess the conflict between the time of the ceasefire agreement in 2002 and the defeat of the LTTE in 2009.",set(),0,"['Lankan Civil War', 'Sri Lankan', 'almost 26 years', 'The Sri Lankan Civil War (Sinhala: ශ්\u200dරී ලංකාවේ', 'Tamil', 'Sri Lanka', '1983 to 2009', '23 July 1983', 'the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam', 'the Tamil Tigers', 'Tamil Eelam', 'Sri Lankan', 'the Tamil Tigers', 'May 2009', 'over 25 years', '2013', 'UN', 'Sri Lankan', 'the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam', 'the United States', 'India', 'Canada', 'the European Union', 'Sri Lankan', 'two decades', 'the Indian Army', 'the Indian Peace Keeping Force', '1987 to 1990', 'December 2001', '2002', 'late 2005', 'July 2006', 'Eastern', '2007', '2 January 2008', 'the Tamil Tigers', 'the Tamil Tigers', 'Kilinochchi', '17 May 2009', 'May 2010', 'Mahinda Rajapaksa', 'Sri Lanka', 'the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission', 'LLRC', '2002', '2009']","['EVENT', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE']"

990,2009,December,18,"James Cameron's ""Avatar"" starring Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver, released in the US, becomes highest-grossing film of all time",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film),"Avatar (marketed as James Cameron's Avatar) is a 2009 American epic science fiction film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron and stars Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver. The film is set in the mid-22nd century when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi – a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.Development of Avatar began in 1994, when Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film. Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film Titanic, for a planned release in 1999, but, according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film. Work on the language of the film's extraterrestrial beings began in 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006. Avatar was officially budgeted at $237 million. Other estimates put the cost between $280 million and $310 million for production and at $150 million for promotion. The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques, and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and for ""4D"" experiences in select South Korean theaters. The stereoscopic filmmaking was touted as a breakthrough in cinematic technology.Avatar premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was released in the United States on December 18 to positive reviews, with critics highly praising its groundbreaking visual effects. During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records and became the highest-grossing film at the time, as well as in the United States and Canada, surpassing Cameron's Titanic, which had held those records for twelve years. Avatar remained the highest-grossing film worldwide for nearly a decade, before being overtaken by Avengers: Endgame in 2019. To this day, Avatar remains the second highest-grossing movie of all time when adjusted for inflation after Gone with the Wind with a total of more than $3 billion. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion and the best-selling film of 2010 in the United States. Avatar was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three, for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects.
Following the film's success, Cameron signed with 20th Century Fox to produce four sequels: Avatar 2 and Avatar 3 have completed principal filming, and are scheduled to be released on December 17, 2021, and December 22, 2023, respectively; subsequent sequels are scheduled to be released on December 19, 2025, and December 17, 2027. Several cast members are expected to return, including Worthington, Saldana, Lang, and Weaver.","{2051, 7, 2568, 521, 3083, 528, 4113, 3090, 1562, 2076, 2589, 2078, 1566, 1058, 4642, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 3630, 1583, 1584, 4661, 2102, 2104, 1081, 4671, 576, 2112, 3139, 580, 2628, 583, 1616, 4688, 1622, 2647, 2649, 2652, 2141, 3676, 4192, 1633, 2152, 1133, 1646, 1136, 1649, 3702, 2169, 3195, 2171, 127, 640, 1153, 130, 131, 2176, 1678, 2703, 144, 3727, 1170, 661, 663, 154, 159, 4768, 2210, 2213, 4775, 1192, 3243, 1197, 1709, 1711, 703, 4287, 2241, 3777, 717, 1233, 3795, 4307, 3803, 3804, 3805, 2274, 1251, 3812, 3813, 3303, 2793, 4330, 748, 2798, 4852, 1783, 1272, 2297, 3322, 1275, 3842, 771, 1795, 4871, 1288, 1292, 1808, 3862, 4890, 1820, 3869, 4895, 1319, 4905, 4400, 4916, 309, 2869, 311, 2875, 4923, 1341, 3903, 1857, 843, 2891, 4941, 4430, 4942, 2901, 3413, 3927, 4437, 1888, 1890, 874, 1386, 4971, 2415, 4472, 889, 3451, 892, 4990, 4993, 4994, 3459, 3460, 2955, 3979, 401, 5010, 3476, 3489, 4516, 936, 4014, 4526, 2483, 2487, 4536, 1465, 1979, 5059, 452, 964, 3524, 4549, 5065, 5067, 2508, 1997, 4558, 4051, 5077, 5079, 3544, 3034, 478, 1502, 3040, 1508, 3046, 3047, 2026, 492, 5107, 1526, 2039, 2040, 3578, 4605}",194,"[""James Cameron's"", 'Avatar', 'Sam Worthington', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Sigourney Weaver', 'US', 'Avatar', ""James Cameron's"", 'Avatar', 'American', 'James Cameron', 'Sam Worthington', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Stephen Lang', 'Michelle Rodriguez', 'Sigourney Weaver', 'the mid-22nd century', 'Pandora', 'Alpha Centauri', 'Pandora', ""Na'vi"", 'Pandora.', '1994', 'Cameron', 'Filming', 'Cameron', '1997', 'Titanic', '1999', 'Cameron', '2005', 'Cameron', 'early 2006', 'Avatar', '3D', 'Dolby 3D', 'XpanD 3D', 'IMAX', '4D', 'South Korean', 'Avatar', 'London', 'December 10, 2009', 'the United States', 'December 18', 'the United States', 'Canada', ""Cameron's Titanic"", 'twelve years', 'Avatar', 'nearly a decade', 'Avengers', '2019', 'this day', 'Avatar', '2010', 'the United States', 'Avatar', 'Academy Awards', 'Best Picture and Best Director', 'Cameron', '20th Century Fox', 'Avatar 2', 'Avatar', 'December 17, 2021', 'December 22, 2023', 'December 19, 2025', 'December 17, 2027', 'Worthington', 'Saldana', 'Lang', 'Weaver']","['PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE']"
991,2009,August,7,“Tik Tok” single released by Kesha (Billboard Song of the Year 2010),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tik_Tok_(song),"""Tik Tok"" (stylized as ""TiK ToK"") is the debut single by American singer Kesha. She co-wrote the song with its producers Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco. It was released on August 7, 2009, as the lead single from Kesha's debut studio album, Animal. The opening line of the song came from an experience where Kesha woke up surrounded by beautiful women, to which she imagined P. Diddy being in a similar scenario. The experience prompted the writing of the song which she later brought to her producer, Dr. Luke, who was then contacted by P. Diddy in hopes of a collaboration; he came to the studio the same day and recorded his lines and the song was completed. According to Kesha, the song's lyrics are representative of her and based on her life; the song has a carefree message and talks about not letting anything bring you down.
The song is an electropop/dance-pop song incorporating a minimalist bitpop beat interspersed with handclaps and synths. The song's verses use a rap/sing vocal style while the chorus is sung; throughout the song the use of Auto-Tune is prominent. Musically, the song has been compared to the works of Lady Gaga, Uffie, and Fergie.
The song achieved commercial success by topping the charts in eleven countries. In the United States, the song broke the record for the biggest single-week sum of all time for a female artist selling 610,000 digital downloads in one week. ""Tik Tok"" was certified 8× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold 6.8 million copies in the United States, topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 9 consecutive weeks. The song was the best-selling single worldwide in 2010, selling 12.8 million copies in that year alone, As of 2019, the song now has sold over 25 million copies, making it the third best-selling digital single worldwide. The song was listed 61st on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of All-time.","{640, 1026, 387, 4611, 2568, 3727, 1938, 1432, 1177, 1566, 4768, 290, 2210, 4134, 4007, 1576, 4905, 5033, 4400, 2483, 1847, 4920, 826, 2875, 4539, 4549, 1990, 967, 2122, 971, 2507, 2891, 4682, 4815, 5074, 595, 3795, 4307, 2141, 2018, 997, 4971, 748, 1133, 3180, 4589, 889, 2171, 5117, 4990}",50,"['Tik Tok', 'Kesha', 'Billboard Song', 'Tik Tok', 'TiK ToK', 'American', 'Kesha', 'Luke', 'Benny Blanco', 'August 7, 2009', 'Kesha', 'Animal', 'Kesha', 'P.

992,2009,January,12,Cristiano Ronaldo is awarded 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year for the first time at a ceremony in Zurich,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo,"Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (European Portuguese: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Serie A club Juventus and captains the Portugal national team. Often considered the best player in the world and  widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballons d'Or and four European Golden Shoes, both of which are records for a European player. He has won 29 trophies in his career, including six league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA European Championship, and one UEFA Nations League. A prolific goalscorer, Ronaldo holds the records for the most goals scored in the UEFA Champions League (128) and the joint-most goals scored in the UEFA European Championship (9). He is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,000 professional career appearances and has scored over 700 senior career goals for club and country.Born and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18. After winning the FA Cup in his first season, he helped United win three successive Premier League titles, the UEFA Champions League, and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. In 2009, Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when signed for Real Madrid in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). There, Ronaldo won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, and four UEFA Champions League titles, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer. After joining Madrid, Ronaldo finished runner-up for the Ballon d'Or three times, behind Lionel Messi – his perceived career rival – before winning back-to-back Ballons d'Or from 2013–2014 and again from 2016–2017. After winning a third consecutive Champions League title in 2018, Ronaldo became the first player to win the trophy five times. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the highest ever paid by an Italian club and the highest ever paid for a player over 30 years old. With the Italian outfit, he has won one Serie A and one Supercoppa Italiana.
A Portuguese international, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation in 2015.

He scored his first international goal at Euro 2004 and helped Portugal reach the final of the competition. He assumed full captaincy in July 2008, leading Portugal to their first-ever triumph in a major tournament by winning Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. He became the highest European international goalscorer of all-time in 2018.One of the most marketable athletes in the world, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and as the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019.

993,2009,March,7,"Despite only being 17 years old, Brazilian soccer star Neymar makes his professional debut for Santos",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar,"Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (Brazilian Portuguese: [nejˈmaʁ dɐ ˈsiwvɐ ˈsɐ̃tus ˈʒũɲoʁ]; born 5 February 1992), commonly known as Neymar Jr. or simply Neymar, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. He is widely considered as one of the best players in the world.
Neymar came into prominence at an early age at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. He helped the club win two successive Campeonato Paulista championships, a Copa do Brasil, and the 2011 Copa Libertadores, with the latter being Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the South American Footballer of the Year, in 2011 and 2012, and soon relocated to Europe to join Barcelona. As part of Barça's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, he won the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and finished third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 for his performances. He then attained a domestic double in the 2015–16 season. In 2017, Neymar transferred from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain in a move worth €222 million, making him the most expensive player ever. In France, he won two league titles, a Coupe de France, and a Coupe de la Ligue, which included a domestic treble and being voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year, in his debut season. Neymar's second season with PSG was injury-riddled and marked by controversies.With 61 goals in 101 matches for Brazil since debuting at age 18, Neymar is the third highest goalscorer for his national team, trailing only Pelé and Ronaldo. He was a key player in Brazil's victories at the 2011 South American Youth Championship, where he finished as leading goalscorer, and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, where he won the Golden Ball as player of the tournament. His participation in the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 Copa América was cut short by injury and a suspension, respectively, but, the following year, he captained Brazil to their first Olympic gold medal in men's football at the 2016 Summer Olympics, and two years later, featured at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
Off the pitch, Neymar ranks among the world's most prominent sportsmen; SportsPro named him the most marketable athlete in the world in 2012 and 2013, and ESPN cited him as the world's fourth-most famous athlete in 2016. In 2017, Neymar was included by Time in its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

The earthquake occurred at 16:53 local time (21:53 UTC) on Tuesday, 12 January 2010.By 24 January, at least 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater had been recorded. An estimated three million people were affected by the quake. Death toll estimates range from 100,000 to about 160,000 to Haitian government figures from 220,000 to 316,000, although these latter figures are a matter of some dispute. The government of Haiti estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings had collapsed or were severely damaged. The nation's history of national debt, prejudicial trade policies by other countries, and foreign intervention into national affairs, contributed to the existing poverty and poor housing conditions that increased the death toll from the disaster.The earthquake caused major damage in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel and other cities in the region. Notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building, the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, and the main jail. Among those killed were Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Joseph Serge Miot, and opposition leader Micha Gaillard. The headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), located in the capital, collapsed, killing many, including the Mission's Chief, Hédi Annabi.Many countries responded to appeals for humanitarian aid, pledging funds and dispatching rescue and medical teams, engineers and support personnel. The most-watched telethon in history aired on 22 January, called ""Hope for Haiti Now,"" raising US$58 million by the next day. Communication systems, air, land, and sea transport facilities, hospitals, and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake, which hampered rescue and aid efforts; confusion over who was in charge, air traffic congestion, and problems with prioritising flights further complicated early relief work. Port-au-Prince's morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies. These had to be buried in mass graves.As rescues tailed off, supplies, medical care and sanitation became priorities. Delays in aid distribution led to angry appeals from aid workers and survivors, and looting and sporadic violence were observed. On 22 January, the United Nations noted that the emergency phase of the relief operation was drawing to a close, and on the following day, the Haitian government officially called off the search for survivors.","{264, 1288, 1162, 2955, 4113, 663, 152, 3612, 2076, 4511, 2722, 4516, 3365, 1192, 3119, 48, 177, 4785, 1204, 2487, 2104, 1979, 4923, 3005, 703, 576, 4287, 66, 4547, 452, 2884, 3268, 843, 2763, 2514, 4563, 2388, 2261, 2901, 471, 2647, 2137, 3676, 4829, 1374, 223, 1502, 4193, 355, 996, 1251, 2026, 4971, 5099, 3054, 3186, 4477, 375, 3578, 4605}",60,"['Earthquake Devastates Haiti', '2010', 'Haiti', 'French', 'Haitian', '2010', 'nan peyi Ayiti', 'Léogâne', 'Haiti', 'Tuesday', '12 January', '24 January', 'Haitian', 'Haiti', 'Port-au-Prince', 'Jacmel', 'the Presidential Palace', 'the National Assembly', 'Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Joseph Serge Miot', 'Micha Gaillard', 'the United Nations Stabilization Mission', 'Haiti', '22 January', 'Hope for Haiti Now', 'the next day', '22 January', 'the United Nations', 'the following day', 'Haitian']","['PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP']"

This unit was reorganized at the start of the American Civil War as the 3rd U.S. Cavalry Regiment on 3 August 1861. In January 1943, the regiment was re-designated as the 3rd Cavalry Group (Mechanized). Today they are equipped with Stryker vehicles. The 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment was the last heavy armored cavalry regiment in the U.S. Army until it officially became a Stryker regiment on 16 November 2011. It will retain its lineage as the 3rd Cavalry Regiment.Under various names it has seen action during eleven major conflicts: the Indian Wars, the Mexican–American War, the American Civil War, the Spanish–American War, the Philippine–American War, World War I, World War II, the Persian Gulf War, SFOR in Bosnia, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, Operation Enduring Freedom and most recently Operation Inherent Resolve.
Twenty-three of the regiment's troopers received the Medal of Honor, all awarded for gallantry in action between 1871 and 1898.

1007,2010,December,22,"Repeal of the ""Don't Ask Don't Tell policy"", a 17-year-old policy banning homosexuals serving openly in the US military, signed into law by President Barack Obama","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell","""Don't ask, don't tell"" (DADT) was the official United States policy on military service by gays, bisexuals, and lesbians, instituted by the Clinton Administration on February 28, 1994, when Department of Defense Directive 1304.26 issued on December 21, 1993, took effect, lasting until September 20, 2011. The policy prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing closeted homosexual or bisexual service members or applicants, while barring openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons from military service. This relaxation of legal restrictions on service by gays and lesbians in the armed forces was mandated by United States federal law Pub.L. 103–160 (10 U.S.C. § 654), which was signed November 30, 1993. The policy prohibited people who ""demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts"" from serving in the armed forces of the United States, because their presence ""would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability"".The act prohibited any homosexual or bisexual person from disclosing their sexual orientation or from speaking about any homosexual relationships, including marriages or other familial attributes, while serving in the United States armed forces. The act specified that service members who disclose that they are homosexual or engage in homosexual conduct should be separated (discharged) except when a service member's conduct was ""for the purpose of avoiding or terminating military service"" or when it ""would not be in the best interest of the armed forces"". Since DADT ended in 2011, persons who are openly homosexual and bisexual have been able to serve.The ""don't ask"" part of the DADT policy specified that superiors should not initiate investigation of a service member's orientation without witnessing disallowed behaviors, though credible evidence of homosexual behavior could be used to initiate an investigation. Unauthorized investigations and harassment of suspected servicemen and women led to an expansion of the policy to ""don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue, don't harass"".Beginning in the early 2000s, several legal challenges to DADT were filed, and legislation to repeal DADT was enacted in December 2010, specifying that the policy would remain in place until the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certified that repeal would not harm military readiness, followed by a 60-day waiting period. A July 6, 2011, ruling from a federal appeals court barred further enforcement of the U.S. military's ban on openly gay service members. President Barack Obama, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen sent that certification to Congress on July 22, 2011, which set the end of DADT to September 20, 2011.","{128, 640, 3970, 131, 3460, 4101, 1808, 4758, 1432, 3869, 4768, 2721, 1573, 2342, 807, 4134, 4647, 4775, 4014, 2096, 2995, 4916, 311, 3895, 2875, 4539, 2628, 4549, 967, 5065, 2122, 971, 1483, 717, 2507, 2764, 3277, 4682, 4688, 595, 3795, 4307, 4691, 2391, 4815, 4313, 5077, 3805, 3040, 2529, 3303, 4986, 619, 2155, 3180, 1136, 5106, 1653, 3190, 3702, 2169, 4474, 3451, 4990, 4859}",65,"['US', 'Barack Obama', 'United States', 'the Clinton Administration', 'February 28, 1994', 'Department of Defense Directive 1304.26', 'December 21, 1993', 'September 20, 2011', 'United States', 'U.S.C.', 'November 30, 1993', 'the United States', 'the United States', '2011', 'harass""', 'the early 2000s', 'December 2010', 'Defense', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'July 6, 2011', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Leon Panetta', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Mike Mullen', 'Congress', 'July 22, 2011', 'September 20, 2011']","['GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE']"
1008,2010,July,8,"""Inception"", directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, premieres in London",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Rises,"The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan, and the story with David S. Goyer. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the final installment in Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy, and the sequel to The Dark Knight (2008). Christian Bale stars as Bruce Wayne / Batman, alongside Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Morgan Freeman. Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, merciless revolutionary Bane forces Bruce Wayne to resume his role as Batman and save Gotham City from nuclear destruction.
Christopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series for a third film, but agreed after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 ""Knightfall"" storyline, the 1986 series The Dark Knight Returns, and the 1999 storyline ""No Man's Land"". Filming took place from May to November 2011 in locations including Jodhpur, London, Nottingham, Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, and Pittsburgh. Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the picture. A vehicle variation of the Batplane and Batcopter termed the ""Bat"", an underground prison set, and a new Batcave set were created specifically for the film. As with The Dark Knight, viral marketing campaigns began early during production. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign: developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information regarding the film's plot.
The Dark Knight Rises premiered in New York City on July 16, 2012. The film was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012. The film received positive reviews, with praise being directed toward the performances, action sequences, screenplay, direction, musical score, and emotional depth, with many critics deeming it a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The consensus at Rotten Tomatoes calls it ""ambitious, thoughtful, and potent"". The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the second film in the Batman film series to earn $1 billion. In addition to being Nolan's highest-grossing film, it became the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time, as well as the third-highest-grossing film of 2012.","{515, 7, 3091, 4642, 3632, 4661, 2102, 2112, 4675, 580, 1605, 4688, 595, 97, 612, 3686, 1646, 1136, 2171, 4736, 4235, 1170, 2721, 2210, 4770, 3243, 1197, 1709, 176, 694, 703, 1235, 3284, 4307, 4824, 3813, 4330, 3322, 1275, 256, 3842, 1795, 3332, 4879, 3862, 4899, 2342, 3882, 3371, 815, 4407, 4923, 4413, 4426, 2891, 4940, 1357, 4430, 2388, 3413, 3927, 1888, 1890, 3427, 4967, 4971, 4472, 889, 4986, 892, 4990, 387, 900, 1929, 3978, 2955, 3979, 403, 2964, 1944, 4526, 2483, 948, 1464, 1465, 1979, 3524, 2508, 1997, 2000, 4051, 2004, 1502, 4589, 2039, 3578, 4605}",97,"['Christopher Nolan', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Joseph Gordon-Levitt', 'London', 'The Dark Knight Rises', '2012', 'Christopher Nolan', 'Jonathan Nolan', 'David S.

In the early years, Australia's athletes did poorly; only two athletes placed in the top half of their events before 1976, while the vast majority placed in the bottom quarter, including some who finished last. This lack of success was attributed to the Australian culture, climate and lack of snow, as well as the lack of support for the athletes—sports administrators regarded investment in winter sports as futile.
After the appointment of Geoff Henke—who had been unable to compete in 1956 after the administrators neglected to endorse his ice hockey team's application—as team manager in 1976, the results slowly began to improve, and by the 1990s, some Australians were regarded as medal prospects. The upturn in performance was accompanied by increased government funding for winter sports, the creation of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia and the purchase of an alpine training base in Austria.
Australia won its first medal, a bronze, in 1994 in the men's 5,000 metres short track relay speed skating event. Zali Steggall gained Australia's first individual medal in 1998, when she won bronze in the slalom event. In 2002, Steven Bradbury won the 1,000 metres short track speed skating and Alisa Camplin won the aerials event, making Australia the only southern hemisphere country to have won a gold medal at a Winter Olympics.
Australia sent 40 competitors to compete in 10 sports at the 2006 Games in Turin. Their goal of winning a medal was achieved when Dale Begg-Smith won the gold in men's freestyle moguls skiing. Camplin claimed her second medal, a bronze in the aerials event.
At the 2010 Games in Vancouver Australia had its most successful Winter Olympics taking home two gold and one silver medal. Begg-Smith won a silver in the moguls, while Torah Bright and Lydia Lassila won the women's half-pipe snowboarding and aerial freestyle skiing respectively.
At the 2014 Games, Australia sent its largest ever Winter Olympic Team, 60 athletes, to Sochi, competing in 10 sports. The Sochi Team included 31 female athletes making it the first Australian Olympic Team, Summer or Winter, with more female athletes than male.  Australia again won three medals with David Morris (aerial skiing) and Torah Bright (snowboard halfpipe) winning silver and Lydia Lassila (aerial skiing) finishing with bronze.

Under common law, the Crown is inherited by a sovereign's children or by a childless sovereign's nearest collateral line. The Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701 restrict succession to the throne to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover who are in ""communion with the Church of England"". Spouses of Roman Catholics were disqualified from 1689 until the law was amended in 2015. Protestant descendants of those excluded for being Roman Catholics are eligible.Queen Elizabeth II is the sovereign, and her heir apparent is her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales. Next in line after him is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales's elder son. Third in line is Prince George, the eldest child of the Duke of Cambridge, followed by his sister, Princess Charlotte, and younger brother, Prince Louis. Sixth in line is Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, the younger son of the Prince of Wales. Under the Perth Agreement, which came into effect in 2015, only the first six in line of succession require the sovereign's consent before they marry; without such consent, they and their children would be disqualified from succession.
The first four individuals in the line of succession who are over 21, and the sovereign's consort, may be appointed Counsellors of State. Counsellors of State perform some of the sovereign's duties in the United Kingdom while he or she is out of the country or temporarily incapacitated. Otherwise, individuals in the line of succession need not have specific legal or official roles.
The United Kingdom is one of the 16 Commonwealth realms. Each of those countries has the same person as monarch and the same order of succession. In 2011, the prime ministers of the realms agreed unanimously to adopt a common approach to amending the rules on the succession to their respective Crowns so that absolute primogeniture would apply for persons born after the date of the agreement, instead of male-preference primogeniture, and the ban on marriages to Roman Catholics would be lifted, but the monarch would still need to be in communion with the Church of England. After the necessary legislation had been enacted in accordance with each realm's constitution, the changes took effect on 26 March 2015.","{640, 4993, 3842, 515, 4994, 7, 2955, 3727, 4879, 1275, 3989, 5019, 4895, 4768, 1058, 3365, 39, 4905, 302, 1584, 4785, 2104, 4024, 4539, 1084, 703, 2241, 3777, 452, 580, 964, 583, 1608, 4682, 2891, 4940, 3322, 595, 2388, 3451, 1622, 3795, 4307, 4563, 5077, 987, 4829, 889, 1888, 5092, 2152, 4330, 4971, 620, 4589, 1649, 4472, 2169, 3578, 2171, 4605}",61,"['Lady Cosima Windsor', 'Alexander Windsor', 'Earl', 'British', '28 October 2011', 'Crown', 'The Bill of Rights 1689', 'the Act of Settlement 1701', 'Protestant', 'Sophia of Hanover', 'the Church of England', 'Roman Catholics', '1689', '2015', 'Roman Catholics', 'Queen Elizabeth II', 'Charles', 'Prince William', 'Duke', 'Cambridge', ""the Prince of Wales's"", 'Prince George', 'Cambridge', 'Charlotte', 'Prince Louis', 'Prince Harry', 'Sussex', 'the Prince of Wales', 'the Perth Agreement', '2015', 'only the first six', 'Counsellors of State', 'State', 'the United Kingdom', 'The United Kingdom', '2011', 'realms', 'Roman Catholics', 'the Church of England', 'March 2015']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'LAW', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE']"
1016,2010,May,28,"Prince Louis of Bourbon, elder son of Prince Louis, Duke of Anjou",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France,"Louis XIV (Louis Dieudonné; 5 September 1638 – 1 September 1715), known as  Louis the Great (Louis le Grand) or the Sun King (le Roi Soleil), was King of France from 14 May 1643 until his death in 1715. His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest recorded of any monarch of a sovereign country in European history. In the age of absolutism in Europe, Louis XIV's France was a leader in the growing centralisation of power.Louis began his personal rule of France in 1661, after the death of his chief minister, the Italian Cardinal Mazarin. An adherent of the concept of the divine right of kings, Louis continued his predecessors' work of creating a centralised state governed from the capital. He sought to eliminate the remnants of feudalism persisting in parts of France and, by compelling many members of the nobility to inhabit his lavish Palace of Versailles, succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many members of which had participated in the Fronde rebellion during Louis' minority. By these means he became one of the most powerful French monarchs and consolidated a system of absolute monarchical rule in France that endured until the French Revolution. He also enforced uniformity of religion under the Gallican Catholic Church. His revocation of the Edict of Nantes abolished the rights of the Huguenot Protestant minority and subjected them to a wave of dragonnades, effectively forcing Huguenots to emigrate or convert, and virtually destroying the French Protestant community.
During Louis' long reign, France was the leading European power, and it fought three major wars: the Franco-Dutch War, the War of the League of Augsburg, and the War of the Spanish Succession. There were also two lesser conflicts: the War of Devolution and the War of the Reunions. Warfare defined the foreign policy of Louis XIV, and his personality shaped his approach. Impelled ""by a mix of commerce, revenge, and pique"", Louis sensed that warfare was the ideal way to enhance his glory. In peacetime he concentrated on preparing for the next war. He taught his diplomats that their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military.","{2051, 7, 528, 3093, 2590, 4138, 4140, 1583, 4661, 4671, 576, 2112, 66, 580, 4684, 595, 2647, 3676, 2141, 606, 1121, 1633, 2152, 1646, 1136, 3185, 3186, 629, 3702, 2169, 2682, 127, 1153, 650, 1162, 3722, 1678, 1170, 663, 1177, 2210, 1703, 680, 1192, 3243, 1709, 4785, 1204, 3252, 2743, 4287, 2241, 1730, 1732, 3268, 3272, 2767, 4307, 2262, 3803, 1757, 4829, 1251, 3812, 3813, 2278, 2793, 234, 3322, 3842, 1288, 3862, 3365, 1341, 843, 4430, 4944, 2388, 2901, 3413, 3927, 1888, 1890, 3427, 4971, 3436, 2415, 889, 3451, 892, 387, 903, 2955, 3979, 5003, 1424, 1938, 3989, 3483, 4516, 5033, 4526, 2483, 2487, 1979, 3519, 3524, 453, 5065, 4051, 990, 2529, 1508, 5097, 2026, 4589, 494, 1526, 2039, 3578, 4605}",121,"['Prince Louis of Bourbon', 'Prince Louis', 'Anjou', 'Louis XIV', 'Louis Dieudonné', '5 September 1638', 'the Sun King', 'Roi Soleil', 'France', 'May 1643', '1715', '72 years', '110 days', 'European', 'Europe', ""Louis XIV's"", 'France', 'Louis', 'France', '1661', 'Italian', 'Cardinal Mazarin', 'Louis', 'France', 'Palace of Versailles', 'Fronde', 'Louis', 'French', 'France', 'the French Revolution', 'the Gallican Catholic Church', 'Huguenot Protestant', 'French', 'Louis', 'France', 'European', 'the Franco-Dutch War', 'the War of the League of Augsburg', 'the War of the Spanish Succession', 'the War of Devolution', 'the War of the Reunions', 'Warfare', 'Louis XIV', 'Louis', 'French']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP']"

1023,2011,January,14,"Tunisian president Ben Ali, flees to Saudi Arabia after popular protests known as the Jasmine Revolution",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_Revolution,"The Tunisian Revolution, also called the Jasmine Revolution, was an intensive 28-day campaign of civil resistance. It included a series of street demonstrations which took place in Tunisia, and led to the ousting of longtime president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. It eventually led to a thorough democratisation of the country and to free and democratic elections.The demonstrations were caused by high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of political freedoms (such as freedom of speech) and poor living conditions. The protests constituted the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades and resulted in scores of deaths and injuries, most of which were the result of action by police and security forces.
The protests were sparked by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi on 17 December 2010. They led to the ousting of Ben Ali on 14 January 2011, when he officially resigned after fleeing to Saudi Arabia, ending his 23 years in power. Labor unions were an integral part of the protests. The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet was awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for ""its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Tunisian Revolution of 2011"". The protests inspired similar actions throughout the Arab world, in a chain reaction which became known as the Arab Spring movement.","{3970, 2051, 387, 892, 4235, 1678, 1938, 1557, 3862, 2210, 1979, 4413, 967, 1483, 1739, 2507, 4430, 467, 4051, 4307, 4691, 5080, 3803, 2141, 4445, 1888, 1890, 3812, 5092, 873, 4971, 1388, 4589, 1646, 1136, 2682, 2171, 2684}",38,"['Tunisian', 'Ben Ali', 'Saudi Arabia', 'The Tunisian Revolution', 'the Jasmine Revolution', 'Tunisia', 'Zine El Abidine', 'Ben Ali', 'January 2011', 'Tunisia', 'three decades', 'Mohamed Bouazizi', '17 December 2010', 'Ben Ali', '14 January 2011', 'Saudi Arabia', '23 years', 'The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet', '2015', 'Nobel Peace Prize', 'Tunisia', 'the Tunisian Revolution of 2011""', 'Arab', 'Arab']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'NORP']"

The events ended with the  2013 Egyptian coup d'état after millions of protesters across Egypt took to the streets and demanded the immediate resignation of the president. The rallies were partly a response to Tamarod, a grassroots movement that launched a petition in April earlier that year calling for the government to step down and it claimed to have collected more than 29 million signatures. According to the Egyptian military, which calculated figured via helicopter scans of demonstration perimeters across the country, this was ""the biggest protest in Egypt's history"", with 32 million protesters.

The uprising concluded seven months of protests that started when the Morsi government issued a highly controversial constitutional declaration that gave him temporary sweeping  powers over the state's judicial system until the new constitution was passed. The demonstrations, which had started peacefully, turned violent when the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood were stormed in Mokattam in Cairo and when 5 members of the organization were killed amid clashes. At the same time, many Morsi supporters staged a relatively smaller rally in Rabaa al-Adawiya square in Nasr City, a district of Cairo. A total of 16 people were reported to have lost their lives on Sunday and approximately 200 injured as of late Tuesday during the unrest as a result of clashes between pro and anti-Morsi demonstrators, according to the state-run news agency. Another 10 people were also reported to have been killed in the cities of Alexandria, Mersa Matruh and Minya.On 1 July, amid the turmoil the country was facing, the military delivered a nationwide TV and radio statement giving both the government and the opposition a 48-hour ultimatum to resolve the political crisis and meet the people's demands or it would intervene to restore order. The following day, Morsi delivered an evening speech where he declared his rejection of the declaration claiming he was the elected president who represented the will of the people. The same day, another statement was released on the official Facebook page of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces titled ""The Final Hours"" that read: ""We swear by God that we are ready to sacrifice our blood for Egypt and its people against any terrorist, extremist or fool"".On the night of 3 July, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, head of the Egyptian Armed Forces, announced in a live televised address that Mohamed Morsi had been deposed and replaced by the head of the constitutional court Adly Mansour and that the constitution had been suspended. Morsi was immediately detained and kept under house arrest at the Republican Guard headquarters in Cairo while several other government officials and Islamist figures supporting Morsi were also arrested. The move marked a turning point for the country's future and for the fate of the Muslim Brotherhood, as it was designated a terrorist group later that year in response to a bombing in Mansoura (even though Ansar Bait al-Maqdis claimed responsibility) and was subjected to an unprecedented crackdown amid an ongoing Islamist unrest. A crackdown by the military on the sit-in at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square led to the August 2013 Rabaa massacre, which Human Rights Watch described as 'one of the world's largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history' and led to the deaths of at least 817 people in Rabaa itself and 904 people across the country by the end of 14 August. Ten members of the security forces were also killed.","{4614, 7, 3081, 1036, 1555, 1058, 4134, 1583, 565, 4671, 1092, 4682, 3666, 595, 1622, 2141, 3693, 1649, 3185, 2169, 2171, 640, 130, 2184, 1162, 2703, 144, 3727, 4756, 4758, 1177, 4768, 4775, 1192, 3243, 182, 703, 202, 718, 208, 3795, 4307, 4825, 234, 3322, 3842, 1288, 1292, 273, 4895, 2342, 3903, 2379, 847, 2388, 2901, 3413, 4445, 1888, 874, 4971, 1388, 2415, 1908, 889, 4986, 3451, 4993, 3970, 4994, 900, 2955, 3979, 3989, 2483, 4024, 4539, 3524, 4549, 4563, 2004, 5077, 987, 1508, 2026, 4589, 1526, 2040, 4605}",89,"['Egyptian', '2011', 'Cairo', 'Alexandria', '30 June', 'Egypt', '30 June 2013', 'one-year', ""Mohamed Morsi's"", 'Egyptian', 'Egypt', 'Tamarod', 'April earlier that year', 'Egyptian', 'Egypt', 'Egypt', 'Washington', 'July 2017}}</ref', 'Morsi', 'Islamist', 'seven months', 'Morsi', 'the Muslim Brotherhood', 'Mokattam', 'Cairo', 'Morsi', 'Rabaa al-Adawiya', 'Nasr City', 'Cairo', 'Sunday', 'late Tuesday', 'anti-Morsi', 'Alexandria', 'Mersa Matruh', 'Minya', '1 July', 'The following day', 'Morsi', 'The same day', 'Facebook', 'the Supreme Council', 'the Armed Forces', 'The Final Hours', 'Egypt', 'Abdel Fattah el-Sisi', 'the Egyptian Armed Forces', 'Mohamed Morsi', 'Adly Mansour', 'Morsi', 'the Republican Guard', 'Cairo', 'Islamist', 'Morsi', 'the Muslim Brotherhood', 'later that year', 'Mansoura', 'Ansar', 'Bait al-Maqdis', 'Islamist', 'Rabaa al-Adawiya Square', 'August 2013', 'Human Rights Watch', 'a single day', 'Rabaa', 'the end of 14 August']","['NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE']"
1025,2011,February,11,Egyptian Revolution culminates in the resignation of Hosni Mubarak and the transfer of power to the Supreme Military Council after 18 days of protests (Arab Spring),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser,"Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein (UK: , US: ; Arabic: جمال عبد الناصر حسين‎, romanized: Jamāl ʻAbdu n-Nāṣir Ḥusayn, Egyptian Arabic: [ɡæˈmæːl ʕæbdenˈnɑːsˤeɾ ħeˈseːn]; 15 January 1918 – 28 September 1970) was the second President of Egypt, serving from 1954 until his death in 1970. Nasser led the 1952 overthrow of the monarchy and introduced far-reaching land reforms the following year. Following a 1954 attempt on his life by a Muslim Brotherhood member, he cracked down on the organization, put President Mohamed Naguib under house arrest and assumed executive office. He was formally elected president in June 1956.
Nasser's popularity in Egypt and the Arab world skyrocketed after his nationalization of the Suez Canal and his political victory in the subsequent Suez Crisis. Calls for pan-Arab unity under his leadership increased, culminating with the formation of the United Arab Republic with Syria from 1958 to 1961. In 1962, Nasser began a series of major socialist measures and modernization reforms in Egypt. Despite setbacks to his pan-Arabist cause, by 1963 Nasser's supporters gained power in several Arab countries, but he became embroiled in the North Yemen Civil War and eventually the much larger Arab Cold War. He began his second presidential term in March 1965 after his political opponents were banned from running. Following Egypt's defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, Nasser resigned, but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement. By 1968, Nasser had appointed himself Prime Minister, launched the War of Attrition to regain lost territory, began a process of depoliticizing the military and issued a set of political liberalization reforms. After the conclusion of the 1970 Arab League summit, Nasser suffered a heart attack and died. His funeral in Cairo drew five million mourners and an outpouring of grief across the Arab world.
Nasser remains an iconic figure in the Arab world, particularly for his strides towards social justice and Arab unity, modernization policies and anti-imperialist efforts. His presidency also encouraged and coincided with an Egyptian cultural boom and launched large industrial projects, including the Aswan Dam and Helwan city. Nasser's detractors criticize his authoritarianism, his human rights violations and his dominance of military over civil institutions, establishing a pattern of military and dictatorial rule in Egypt.","{2051, 4101, 1557, 2589, 2078, 2080, 1573, 3110, 4134, 1576, 4647, 1583, 2096, 561, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4688, 3154, 595, 3666, 2141, 606, 1633, 2155, 3180, 1136, 1653, 3702, 2169, 2170, 2171, 2684, 128, 640, 1153, 131, 2176, 4235, 3727, 4758, 1177, 4768, 2210, 680, 684, 3272, 2764, 717, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 4313, 1757, 3805, 2278, 2793, 234, 2794, 2798, 1783, 3322, 3834, 4859, 3842, 1808, 3869, 807, 4916, 309, 311, 4920, 2875, 4413, 2891, 1388, 2415, 889, 4474, 4990, 3970, 3460, 903, 1432, 418, 4014, 2483, 2995, 4539, 453, 4549, 967, 5065, 971, 2507, 5077, 3040, 2529, 1508, 5106, 1526, 5117}",103,"['Egyptian', 'Hosni Mubarak', 'the Supreme Military Council', '18 days', 'Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein', 'UK', 'US', 'Arabic', 'Jamāl ʻAbdu', 'n-Nāṣir Ḥusayn', 'Egyptian', '15 January 1918', '28 September 1970', 'Egypt', '1954', '1970', 'Nasser', '1952', 'the following year', '1954', 'Muslim Brotherhood', 'Mohamed Naguib', 'June 1956', 'Nasser', 'Egypt', 'Arab', 'the Suez Canal', 'Suez Crisis', 'pan-Arab', 'the United Arab Republic', 'Syria', '1958 to 1961', '1962', 'Nasser', 'Egypt', '1963', 'Nasser', 'Arab', 'the North Yemen Civil War', 'Arab Cold War', 'March 1965', 'Egypt', 'Israel', 'the 1967 Six-Day War', 'Nasser', '1968', 'Nasser', 'the War of Attrition', '1970', 'Arab League', 'Nasser', 'Cairo', 'Arab', 'Nasser', 'Arab', 'Arab', 'Egyptian', 'Helwan', 'Nasser', 'Egypt']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE']"

It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan, and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900.
The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that may have reached heights of up to 40.5 meters (133 ft) in Miyako in Tōhoku's Iwate Prefecture, and which, in the Sendai area, traveled at 700 km/h (435 mph) for up to 10 km (6 mi) inland. Residents of Sendai had only eight to ten minutes of warning, and more than a hundred evacuation sites were washed away.The earthquake moved Honshu (the main island of Japan) 2.4 m (8 ft) east, shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm (4 in) and 25 cm (10 in), increased earth's rotational speed by 1.8 µs per day, and generated infrasound waves detected in perturbations of the low-orbiting Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer satellite.
Initially, the earthquake caused sinking of part of Honshu's Pacific coast by up to roughly a metre, but after about three years, the coast rose back and kept on rising to exceed its original height.The tsunami swept the Japanese mainland and killed over ten thousand people, mainly through drowning, though blunt trauma also caused many deaths. The latest report from the Japanese National Police Agency report confirms 15,899 deaths, 6,157 injured, and 2,529 people missing across twenty prefectures, and a report from 2015 indicated 228,863 people were still living away from their home in either temporary housing or due to permanent relocation.A report by the National Police Agency of Japan on 10 September 2018 listed 121,778 buildings as ""total collapsed"", with a further 280,926 buildings ""half collapsed"", and another 699,180 buildings ""partially damaged"". The earthquake and tsunami also caused extensive and severe structural damage in north-eastern Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said, ""In the 65 years after the end of World War II, this is the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan."" Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.5 million without water.The tsunami caused nuclear accidents, primarily the level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex, and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. Many electrical generators ran out of fuel. The loss of electrical power halted cooling systems, causing heat to build up. The heat build-up caused the generation of hydrogen gas. Without ventilation, gas accumulated within the reactor containment structures and eventually exploded. Residents within a 20 km (12 mi) radius of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and a 10 km (6.2 mi) radius of the Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated.
Early estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion. The Bank of Japan offered ¥15 trillion (US$183 billion) to the banking system on 14 March in an effort to normalize market conditions. The World Bank's estimated economic cost was US$235 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster in history.","{2051, 7, 528, 3601, 4113, 1566, 4134, 2092, 1583, 4661, 2119, 2122, 4682, 3154, 595, 2645, 603, 2141, 607, 1633, 3180, 1646, 1136, 1649, 3186, 3702, 2169, 127, 128, 640, 1153, 1162, 1678, 2703, 3727, 1177, 4768, 2210, 4785, 704, 3777, 3268, 1739, 2763, 1746, 3795, 4307, 2261, 3799, 3803, 4829, 1251, 3812, 743, 2793, 2794, 3322, 4859, 2302, 3842, 1795, 1288, 3862, 3864, 1821, 4895, 290, 3365, 1832, 4905, 810, 2875, 1343, 2884, 841, 2891, 4430, 2388, 2901, 1369, 1888, 1890, 873, 2415, 2929, 375, 889, 4474, 3451, 892, 893, 895, 4993, 4994, 387, 900, 903, 2955, 3468, 3979, 1938, 4498, 3989, 418, 3490, 4526, 2483, 4024, 442, 1979, 4539, 3520, 452, 3524, 4549, 5062, 3528, 971, 2507, 2514, 467, 5077, 5080, 3036, 1502, 2529, 1508, 5092, 2026, 3564, 1526, 2039, 4605}",133,"['Sendai', 'Japan', 'Fukushima', '2011', 'the Pacific coast', 'Tōhoku', 'Tōhoku-chihō', 'Taiheiyō Oki Jishin', 'Japan', 'Friday 11 March 2011', 'the Oshika Peninsula', 'Tōhoku', 'Japan', 'the Great East Japan Earthquake', 'Higashi', '2011', 'Tōhoku', 'the Great Sendai Earthquake', 'the Great Tōhoku Earthquake', 'March 11', 'Japan', '1900', 'Miyako', 'Tōhoku', 'Iwate Prefecture', 'Sendai', 'Sendai', 'Honshu', 'Japan', 'east', 'Earth', 'earth', 'Gravity Field', 'Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer', 'Honshu', 'Pacific coast', 'about three years', 'Japanese', 'blunt trauma', 'the Japanese National Police Agency', '2015', 'the National Police Agency', 'Japan', '10 September 2018', 'Japan', 'Japanese', 'Naoto Kan', 'the 65 years', 'World War II', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant', 'the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant', 'The Bank of Japan', '14 March', ""The World Bank's""]","['GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'EVENT', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG']"
1027,2011,April,19,Fidel Castro resigns from the Communist Party of Cuba's central committee after 45 years of holding the title.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro,"Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz (American Spanish: [fiˈðel aleˈxandɾo ˈkastɾo ˈrus]; 13 August 1926 – 25 November 2016) was a Cuban communist revolutionary politician, a Marxist–Leninist and Cuban nationalist. Castro governed the Republic of Cuba as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1961 until 2011, Prime Minister from 1959 to 1976 and then as President of the Council of State and Council of Ministers from 1976 to 2008. Castro also served as the Commander-in-chief of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces. Under his administration, Cuba became a one-party communist state, while industry and business were nationalized and state socialist policies were implemented throughout society.
Born in Birán, Oriente as the son of a wealthy Spanish farmer, Castro adopted leftist anti-imperialist ideas while studying law at the University of Havana. After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, he planned the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953. After a year's imprisonment, Castro traveled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group, the 26th of July Movement, with his brother Raúl Castro and Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. Returning to Cuba, Castro took a key role in the Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista's forces from the Sierra Maestra. After Batista's overthrow in 1959, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's Prime Minister. The United States came to oppose Castro's government and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination, economic blockade, and counter-revolution, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961. Countering these threats, Castro aligned with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba, resulting in the Cuban Missile Crisis – a defining incident of the Cold War – in 1962.
Adopting a Marxist–Leninist model of development, Castro converted Cuba into a one-party, socialist state under Communist Party rule, the first in the Western Hemisphere. Policies introducing central economic planning and expanding healthcare and education were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression of internal dissent. Abroad, Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary groups, backing the establishment of Marxist governments in Chile, Nicaragua, and Grenada, as well as sending troops to aid allies in the Yom Kippur, Ogaden, and Angolan Civil War. These actions, coupled with Castro's leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1979 to 1983 and Cuba's medical internationalism, increased Cuba's profile on the world stage. Following the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991, Castro led Cuba through the economic downturn of the ""Special Period"", embracing environmentalist and anti-globalization ideas. In the 2000s, Castro forged alliances in the Latin American ""pink tide"" – namely with Hugo Chávez's Venezuela – and signed Cuba up to the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. In 2006, Castro transferred his responsibilities to Vice President Raúl Castro, who was elected to the presidency by the National Assembly in 2008.
The longest-serving non-royal head of state in the 20th and 21st centuries, Castro polarized opinion throughout the world. His supporters view him as a champion of socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary regime advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba's independence from US hegemony. Critics view him as a tyrannical dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses, the exodus of a large number of Cubans, and the impoverishment of the country's economy. Castro was decorated with various international awards and significantly influenced different individuals and groups across the world.","{1666, 1157, 4741, 1547, 3213, 2196, 161, 1579, 184, 1598, 4812, 2126, 465, 2257, 1751, 2264, 2524, 1378, 1520, 627, 3324, 4350}",22,"['Fidel Castro', 'the Communist Party', 'Cuba', '45 years', 'Fidel Alejandro', 'American', 'Spanish', 'August 1926', 'November 2016', 'Cuban', 'Marxist', 'Leninist', 'Cuban', 'Castro', 'the Republic of Cuba', 'the Communist Party', 'Cuba', '1961', '2011', '1959', '1976', 'the Council of State and Council of Ministers', '1976 to 2008', 'Castro', 'the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces', 'Cuba', 'communist', 'Birán', 'Oriente', 'Spanish', 'Castro', 'the University of Havana', 'the Dominican Republic and Colombia', 'Cuban', 'Fulgencio Batista', 'the Moncada Barracks', '1953', 'year', 'Castro', 'Mexico', 'Raúl Castro', 'Ernesto', 'Che"" Guevara', 'Cuba', 'Castro', 'the Cuban Revolution', 'Batista', 'the Sierra Maestra', 'Batista', '1959', 'Castro', 'Cuba', 'The United States', 'Castro', 'the Bay of Pigs Invasion', '1961', 'Castro', 'the Soviet Union', 'Soviets', 'Cuba', 'Cuban', 'the Cold War', '1962', 'Marxist', 'Castro', 'Cuba', 'Communist Party', 'the Western Hemisphere', 'Castro', 'Marxist', 'Chile', 'Nicaragua', 'Grenada', 'the Yom Kippur', 'Ogaden', 'Angolan Civil War', 'Castro', 'the Non-Aligned Movement', '1979 to 1983', 'Cuba', 'Cuba', ""the Soviet Union's"", '1991', 'Castro', 'Cuba', 'the 2000s', 'Castro', 'Latin American', ""Hugo Chávez's"", 'Venezuela', 'Cuba', 'the Bolivarian Alliance', 'Americas', '2006', 'Castro', 'Raúl Castro', 'the National Assembly', '2008', 'the 20th and 21st centuries', 'Castro', 'Cuba', 'US', 'Cubans', 'Castro']","['PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON']"

He was a Saudi Arabian citizen until 1994 (stateless thereafter) and a member of the wealthy bin Laden family.Bin Laden's father was Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire from Hadhramaut, Yemen, and the founder of the construction company, Saudi Binladin Group. His mother, Alia Ghanem, was from a secular middle-class family based in Latakia, Syria. He was born in Saudi Arabia and studied at university in the country until 1979, when he joined Mujahideen forces in Pakistan fighting against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He helped to fund the Mujahideen by funneling arms, money and fighters from the Arab world into Afghanistan, and gained popularity among many Arabs. In 1988, he formed al-Qaeda. He was banished from Saudi Arabia in 1992, and shifted his base to Sudan, until U.S. pressure forced him to leave Sudan in 1996. After establishing a new base in Afghanistan, he declared a war against the United States, initiating a series of bombings and related attacks. Bin Laden was on the American Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) lists of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives and Most Wanted Terrorists for his involvement in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings.Bin Laden is most well known for his role in masterminding the September 11 attacks, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 and prompted the United States to initiate the War on Terror. He subsequently became the subject of a decade-long international manhunt. From 2001 to 2011, bin Laden was a major target of the United States, as the FBI offered a $25 million bounty in their search for him. On May 2, 2011, bin Laden was shot and killed by US Navy SEALs inside a private residential compound in Abbottabad, where he lived with a local family from Waziristan.  The covert operation was conducted by members of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (SEAL Team Six) and Central Intelligence Agency SAD/SOG operators on the orders of U.S. President Barack Obama. Under his leadership, the al-Qaeda organization was responsible for, in addition to the September 11 attacks in the United States, many other mass-casualty attacks worldwide.","{1025, 1026, 4611, 4097, 4101, 7, 2568, 521, 524, 4113, 3090, 1562, 2589, 2078, 1573, 4134, 39, 1576, 2601, 4647, 2096, 561, 2104, 1081, 2621, 4671, 2628, 2122, 4682, 4688, 3154, 595, 1622, 2649, 3163, 619, 2155, 3693, 1136, 1649, 628, 3702, 2169, 2170, 3195, 2171, 2684, 128, 640, 2176, 2703, 3727, 4758, 4768, 2210, 2213, 174, 2740, 1228, 717, 2764, 3277, 4815, 3795, 4307, 3285, 4313, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3303, 4330, 748, 2798, 1783, 3322, 1275, 3834, 4859, 3842, 1795, 1808, 3348, 3869, 4895, 290, 3874, 294, 807, 1319, 4905, 4400, 4916, 311, 1847, 4920, 826, 2875, 3903, 3907, 2379, 4942, 2388, 4445, 874, 3434, 3951, 4472, 889, 4474, 3451, 4990, 4993, 3970, 3459, 4994, 903, 2955, 3979, 401, 3989, 1432, 4007, 2475, 4014, 4020, 4024, 1979, 4539, 5059, 452, 4549, 1990, 967, 5065, 971, 2507, 1997, 2508, 4563, 5077, 5079, 3034, 1502, 3040, 2529, 2018, 997, 4589, 5106, 5107, 2040, 4605}",153,"['Osama bin Laden', 'September 11', 'FBI', 'US', 'Abbottabad', 'Pakistan', 'Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden', 'Arabic', 'Usāmah bin Muḥammad bin ʿAwaḍ bin Lādin', 'March 10, 1957', 'May 2, 2011', 'Usama bin Ladin', 'pan-Islamic', 'al-Qaeda', 'Saudi Arabian', '1994', 'bin Laden', ""Bin Laden's"", 'Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden', 'Saudi', 'Hadhramaut', 'Yemen', 'Saudi Binladin Group', 'Alia Ghanem', 'Latakia', 'Syria', 'Saudi Arabia', '1979', 'Mujahideen', 'Pakistan', 'the Soviet Union', 'Afghanistan', 'Mujahideen', 'Arab', 'Afghanistan', 'Arabs', '1988', 'al-Qaeda', 'Saudi Arabia', '1992', 'Sudan', 'U.S.', 'Sudan', '1996', 'Afghanistan', 'the United States', 'Bin Laden', 'the American Federal Bureau of', 'FBI', 'Ten Most Wanted Fugitives', '1998', 'U.S.', 'Bin Laden', 'September 11', 'the United States', 'the War on Terror', 'decade', '2001', 'bin Laden', 'the United States', 'FBI', 'May 2, 2011', 'bin Laden', 'US Navy', 'Abbottabad', 'Waziristan', 'the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group', 'Central Intelligence Agency', 'SAD/SOG', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'al-Qaeda', 'September 11', 'the United States']","['PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PRODUCT', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE']"

attacks by Anders Behring Breivik against the government, the civilian population, and a Workers' Youth League (AUF) summer camp, in which 77 people were killed.
The first attack was a car bomb explosion in Oslo within Regjeringskvartalet, the executive government quarter of Norway, at 15:25:22 (CEST). The bomb was placed inside a van next to the tower block housing the office of the Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. The explosion killed eight people and injured at least 209 people, twelve severely.The second attack occurred less than two hours later at a summer camp on the island of Utøya in Tyrifjorden, Viken. The camp was organized by the AUF, the youth division of the ruling Norwegian Labour Party (AP). Breivik, dressed in a homemade police uniform and showing false identification, took a ferry to the island and opened fire at the participants, killing 69 and injuring at least 110, 55 seriously. Among the dead were friends of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, and the stepbrother of Norway's crown princess Mette-Marit.The attack was the deadliest in Norway since World War II and the shooting at Utøya remains the deadliest mass shooting by a lone perpetrator in history. A survey found that one in four Norwegians knew someone affected. The European Union, NATO and several countries expressed their support for Norway and condemned the attacks. The 2012 Gjørv Report concluded that Norway's police could have prevented the bombing and caught Breivik faster at Utøya, and that measures to prevent further attacks and ""mitigate adverse effects"" should have been implemented.The Norwegian Police arrested Anders Behring Breivik, a 32-year-old Norwegian right-wing extremist, on Utøya island and charged him with both attacks. His trial took place between 16 April and 22 June 2012 in Oslo District Court, where Breivik admitted carrying out the attacks, but denied criminal guilt and claimed the defense of necessity (jus necessitatis).

Established in 1954, the organization is based in a northwest suburb of Geneva on the Franco–Swiss border and has 23 member states. Israel is the only non-European country granted full membership. CERN is an official United Nations Observer.The acronym CERN is also used to refer to the laboratory, which in 2016 had 2,500 scientific, technical, and administrative staff members, and hosted about 12,000 users. In the same year, CERN generated 49 petabytes of data.CERN's main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for high-energy physics research – as a result, numerous experiments have been constructed at CERN through international collaborations. The main site at Meyrin hosts a large computing facility, which is primarily used to store and analyse data from experiments, as well as simulate events. Researchers need remote access to these facilities, so the lab has historically been a major wide area network hub.

It took over 200,000 years of human history for the world's population to reach 1 billion, and only 200 years more to reach 7 billion.The world population has experienced continuous growth following the Great Famine of 1315–1317 and the end of the Black Death in 1350, when it was near 370 million. 
The highest global population growth rates, with increases of over 1.8% per year, occurred between 1955 and 1975—peaking to 2.1% between 1965 and 1970. The growth rate declined to 1.2% between 2010 and 2015 and is projected to decline further in the course of the 21st century. However, the global population is still increasing and is projected to reach about 10 billion in 2050 and more than 11 billion in 2100.Total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 139 million, and as of 2011 were expected to remain essentially constant at a level of 135 million, while deaths numbered 56 million per year and were expected to increase to 80 million per year by 2040.

1042,2012,February,27,Wikileaks begins disclosing 5 million emails from private intelligence company Stratfor,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks,"WikiLeaks () is an international non-profit organisation that publishes news leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources. Its website, initiated in 2006 in Iceland by the organisation Sunshine Press, claimed in 2015 to have released online 10 million documents in its first 10 years. Julian Assange, an Australian Internet activist, is generally described as its founder and director. Since September 2018, Kristinn Hrafnsson has served as its editor-in-chief.The group has released a number of prominent document caches. Early releases included documentation of equipment expenditures and holdings in the Afghanistan war, a report informing a corruption investigation in Kenya, and a manual for operations at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In April 2010, WikiLeaks released the Collateral Murder footage from the 12 July 2007 Baghdad airstrike in which Iraqi journalists were among those killed. Other releases in 2010 included the Afghan War Diary and the ""Iraq War Logs"". The latter allowed the mapping of 109,032 deaths in ""significant"" attacks by insurgents in Iraq that had been reported to Multi-National Force – Iraq, including about 15,000 that had not been previously published. In 2010, WikiLeaks also released the US State Department diplomatic ""cables"", classified cables that had been sent to the US State Department. In April 2011, WikiLeaks began publishing 779 secret files relating to prisoners detained in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In 2012, WikiLeaks released the ""Syria Files,"" over two million emails sent by Syrian politicians, corporations and government ministries. In 2015, WikiLeaks published Saudi Arabian diplomatic cables, documents detailing spying by the U.S. National Security Agency on successive French Presidents, and the intellectual property chapter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a controversial international trade agreement which had been negotiated in secret.During the 2016 US presidential election campaign, WikiLeaks released emails and other documents from the Democratic National Committee and from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta. These releases caused significant harm to the Clinton campaign, and have been attributed as a potential contributing factor to her loss. The U.S. intelligence community expressed ""high confidence"" that the leaked emails had been hacked by Russia and supplied to WikiLeaks, while WikiLeaks denied their source was Russia or any other state. During the campaign, WikiLeaks promoted conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. In private conversations from November 2015 that were later leaked, Julian Assange expressed a preference for a GOP victory in the 2016 election, explaining that ""Dems+Media+liberals woudl [sic] then form a block to reign [sic] in their worst qualities. With Hillary in charge, GOP will be pushing for her worst qualities, dems+media+neoliberals will be mute."" In further leaked correspondence with the Trump campaign on election day (8 November 2016), WikiLeaks encouraged the Trump campaign to contest the election results as being ""rigged"" should they lose.In 2016, WikiLeaks released nearly 300,000 emails it described as coming from Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, later found to be taken from public mailing archives, and over 50,000 emails from the Turkish minister of energy. In 2017, WikiLeaks published internal CIA documents describing tools used by the agency to hack devices including mobile phones and routers.
WikiLeaks has drawn criticism for its alleged absence of whistleblowing on or criticism of Russia, and for criticising the Panama Papers' exposé of businesses and individuals with offshore bank accounts. The organization has additionally been criticised for inadequately curating its content and violating the personal privacy of individuals. WikiLeaks has, for instance, revealed Social Security numbers, medical information, credit card numbers and details of suicide attempts.","{4608, 643, 1929, 3083, 511, 663, 154, 4899, 4516, 1062, 3882, 48, 4913, 2487, 4287, 66, 580, 4807, 3676, 478, 4192, 741, 4718, 2297, 3578, 4991}",26,"['Wikileaks', 'WikiLeaks', '2006', 'Iceland', 'Sunshine Press', '2015', 'its first 10 years', 'Julian Assange', 'Australian', 'September 2018', 'Kristinn Hrafnsson', 'Afghanistan', 'Kenya', 'U.S.', 'Guantanamo Bay', 'Cuba', 'April 2010', 'WikiLeaks', 'Collateral Murder', '12 July 2007', 'Baghdad', 'Iraqi', '2010', 'Afghan', 'the ""Iraq War Logs', 'Iraq', 'Multi-National Force', 'Iraq', '2010', 'WikiLeaks', 'US State Department', 'the US State Department', 'April 2011', 'WikiLeaks', 'Guantanamo Bay', '2012', 'WikiLeaks', 'the ""Syria Files', 'Syrian', '2015', 'WikiLeaks', 'Saudi Arabian', 'the U.S. National Security Agency', 'French', 'the Trans-Pacific Partnership', '2016', 'US', 'WikiLeaks', 'the Democratic National Committee', ""Hillary Clinton's"", 'John Podesta', 'Clinton', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'WikiLeaks', 'WikiLeaks', 'Russia', 'WikiLeaks', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the Democratic Party', 'November 2015', 'Julian Assange', 'GOP', '2016', 'Dems+Media+liberals', 'Hillary', 'GOP', 'Trump', 'election day', 'November 2016', 'WikiLeaks', 'Trump', '2016', 'WikiLeaks', 'Turkey', 'Justice and Development Party', 'Turkish', '2017', 'WikiLeaks', 'CIA', 'Russia', ""the Panama Papers'"", 'WikiLeaks', 'Social Security']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG']"
1043,2012,July,10,The American Episcopal Church becomes the first to approve a rite for blessing gay marriages,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_(United_States),"The Episcopal Church (TEC) is a member church of the worldwide Anglican Communion and is based in the United States with additional dioceses elsewhere. It is a mainline Christian denomination divided into nine provinces. The presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church is Michael Bruce Curry, the first African-American bishop to serve in that position.
In 2018, the Episcopal Church had 1,835,931 baptized members, of whom 1,676,349 were in the United States. In 2011, it was the nation's 14th largest denomination. In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 1.2 percent of the adult population in the United States, or 3 million people, self-identify as mainline Episcopalians.The church was organized after the American Revolution, when it became separate from the Church of England, whose clergy are required to swear allegiance to the British monarch as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The Episcopal Church describes itself as ""Protestant, yet Catholic"". The Episcopal Church claims apostolic succession, tracing its bishops back to the apostles via holy orders. The Book of Common Prayer, a collection of traditional rites, blessings, liturgies, and prayers used throughout the Anglican Communion, is central to Episcopal worship.
The Episcopal Church was active in the Social Gospel movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1960s and 1970s, the church has pursued a decidedly more liberal course. It has opposed the death penalty and supported the civil rights movement and affirmative action. Some of its leaders and priests are known for marching with influential civil rights demonstrators such as Martin Luther King Jr. The church calls for the full legal equality of LGBT people. In 2015, the church's 78th triennial General Convention passed resolutions allowing the blessing of same-sex marriages and approved two official liturgies to bless such unions.The Episcopal Church ordains women and LGBT people to the priesthood, the diaconate, and the episcopate, despite opposition from a number of other member churches of the Anglican Communion. In 2003, Gene Robinson became the first openly gay person ordained as a bishop.","{1026, 2568, 3978, 2955, 524, 3468, 4235, 5010, 1944, 666, 3874, 3365, 1319, 1576, 2171, 174, 815, 176, 1711, 4400, 563, 4785, 4407, 4413, 703, 4671, 580, 586, 3322, 2508, 1997, 4558, 4563, 2004, 4437, 3034, 2525, 4829, 4967, 4330, 748, 4845, 632, 4472, 3578, 3195, 4605, 4990}",48,"['The American Episcopal Church', 'The Episcopal Church', 'Anglican Communion', 'the United States', 'Christian', 'the Episcopal Church', 'Michael Bruce Curry', 'African-American', '2018', 'the Episcopal Church', 'the United States', '2011', '2015', 'Pew Research', '1.2 percent', 'the United States', 'Episcopalians', 'the American Revolution', 'the Church of England', 'British', 'Supreme Governor', 'the Church of England', 'The Episcopal Church', 'Protestant', 'Catholic', 'The Episcopal Church', 'The Book of Common Prayer', 'the Anglican Communion', 'Episcopal', 'The Episcopal Church', 'Social Gospel', 'the late 19th and early 20th centuries', 'the 1960s and 1970s', 'Martin Luther King Jr.', '2015', 'Convention', 'The Episcopal Church', 'the Anglican Communion', '2003', 'Gene Robinson']","['ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERCENT', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'LAW', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON']"
1044,2012,July,18,Kim Jong-un is officially appointed Supreme Leader of North Korea and given the rank of Marshal in the Korean People's Army,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_North_Korea,"The politics of North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or DPRK) takes place within the framework of the official state philosophy, Juche, a concept created by Hwang Jang-yop and later attributed to Kim Il-sung. The Juche theory is the belief that through self-reliance and a strong independent state, true socialism can be achieved.North Korea's political system is built upon the principle of centralization. While the North Korean constitution formally guarantees protection of human rights, in practice there are severe limits on freedom of expression, and the government closely supervises the lives of North Korean citizens. The constitution defines North Korea as ""a dictatorship of people's democracy"" under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), which is given legal supremacy over other political parties.
The WPK is the ruling party of North Korea. It has been in power since its creation in 1948. Two minor political parties also exist, but are legally bound to accept the ruling role of the WPK. They, with the WPK, comprise the popular front Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland (DFRF). Elections occur only in single-candidate races where the candidate is effectively selected beforehand by the WPK.In addition to the parties, there are over 100 mass organizations controlled by the WPK. Those who are not WPK members are required to join one of these organizations. Of these, the most important ones are the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League, Socialist Women's Union of Korea, General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, and Union of Agricultural Workers of Korea. These four organizations are also DFRF members.Kim Il-sung ruled the country from 1948 until his death in July 1994, holding the offices of General Secretary of the WPK from 1949 to 1994 (titled as Chairman from 1949 to 1972), Premier of North Korea from 1948 to 1972 and President from 1972 to 1994. He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-il.  While the younger Kim had been his father's designated successor since the 1980s, it took him three years to consolidate his power. He was named to his father's old post of General Secretary in 1997, and in 1998 became chairman of the National Defence Commission (NDC), which gave him command of the armed forces. The constitution was amended to make the NDC chairmanship ""the highest post in the state."" At the same time, the presidential post was written out of the constitution, and Kim Il-sung was designated ""Eternal President of the Republic"" in order to honor his memory forever. Most analysts believe the title to be a product of the cult of personality he cultivated during his life.
Outside observers generally view North Korea as a Stalinist dictatorship particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around Kim Il-sung and his family. The Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), led by a member of the ruling family, holds power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members. The government has formally replaced all references to Marxism–Leninism in its constitution with the locally developed concept of Juche, or self-reliance. In recent years, there has been great emphasis on the Songun or ""military-first"" philosophy. All references to communism were removed from the North Korean constitution in 2009.The status of the military has been enhanced, and it appears to occupy the center of the North Korean political system; all the social sectors are forced to follow the military spirit and adopt military methods. Kim Jong-il's public activity focused heavily on ""on-the-spot guidance"" of places and events related to the military. The enhanced status of the military and military-centered political system was confirmed at the first session of the 10th Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) by the promotion of NDC members into the official power hierarchy. All ten NDC members were ranked within the top twenty on 5 September, and all but one occupied the top twenty at the fiftieth anniversary of the Day of the Foundation of the Republic on 9 September.","{1026, 2051, 2053, 2055, 524, 528, 3091, 540, 2079, 2080, 550, 4134, 3116, 1583, 4661, 2614, 1613, 2140, 2141, 3678, 3167, 1633, 3686, 1646, 1136, 3185, 1142, 3190, 3192, 2169, 2682, 2171, 3702, 127, 128, 1153, 4736, 3205, 4235, 1678, 2702, 3217, 4756, 1688, 1177, 2210, 4770, 4775, 2729, 3243, 174, 182, 2760, 1739, 1228, 717, 4307, 2261, 1238, 3799, 3803, 1251, 3812, 2278, 1255, 2793, 2794, 3307, 748, 3309, 1780, 757, 1273, 1288, 3348, 3862, 794, 286, 290, 3874, 2342, 310, 4407, 2362, 4413, 4426, 1867, 4430, 849, 2901, 3413, 2391, 1888, 1890, 3431, 873, 3434, 3946, 1388, 4971, 2415, 3951, 3442, 1398, 4986, 3451, 1404, 892, 1409, 3970, 387, 903, 4489, 2443, 2955, 3979, 5003, 3989, 3994, 1949, 418, 3500, 4526, 2483, 2995, 4020, 3524, 965, 967, 1483, 2507, 467, 4051, 2525, 2529, 1508, 997, 998, 2026, 4589, 1526, 2039, 4605}",143,"['Kim Jong-un', 'Supreme Leader', 'North Korea', ""the Korean People's Army"", 'North Korea', ""the Democratic People's Republic of Korea"", 'DPRK', 'Juche', 'Hwang Jang-yop', 'Kim Il-sung', 'Juche', ""North Korea's"", 'North Korean', 'North Korean', 'North Korea', ""the Workers' Party of Korea"", 'WPK', 'WPK', 'North Korea', '1948', 'WPK', 'WPK', 'Democratic', 'DFRF', 'WPK', 'WPK', 'the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League', ""Socialist Women's Union of Korea"", 'General Federation of Trade Unions', 'Korea', 'Union of Agricultural Workers', 'Korea', 'DFRF', 'Kim Il-sung', '1948', 'July 1994', 'WPK', '1949 to 1994', '1949 to 1972', 'North Korea', '1948 to', '1972', '1972 to 1994', 'Kim Jong-il', 'Kim', 'the 1980s', 'three years', '1997', '1998', 'the National Defence Commission', 'NDC', 'NDC', 'Kim Il-sung', 'North Korea', 'Stalinist', 'Kim Il-sung', ""The Workers' Party of Korea"", 'WPK', 'the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland', 'Juche', 'recent years', 'Songun', 'North Korean', 'North Korean', ""Kim Jong-il's"", ""Supreme People's Assembly"", 'NDC', 'NDC', '5 September', 'twenty', 'the Day of the Foundation of the Republic on', '9 September']","['PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE']"

WikiLeaks came to international attention in 2010 when it published a series of leaks provided by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Baghdad airstrike Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and Cablegate (November 2010). After the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks.In November 2010, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange, after questioning him months earlier about allegations of sexual assault. Assange denied the allegations, and said they were a pretext for him to be extradited from Sweden to the United States because of his role in publishing secret American documents. Assange surrendered to UK police on 7 December 2010, but was released on bail within ten days. Having been unsuccessful in his challenge to the extradition proceedings, he breached his £340,000 bail in June 2012 and took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London. He was granted asylum by Ecuador due to fears of political persecution and extradition to the United States. In January 2018, he was granted Ecuadorian citizenship, but this was suspended in 2019. Assange remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London for almost seven years.During the 2016 US Democratic Party presidential primaries, WikiLeaks hosted emails sent or received by candidate Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State. The U.S. Intelligence Community, as well as a Special Counsel investigation, concluded that the Russian government carried out a hacking campaign as part of broader efforts to interfere in the 2016 United States elections. In 2018, twelve Russian intelligence officers, mostly affiliated with the GRU, were indicted on criminal charges by Special Counsel Robert Mueller; the indictment charged the Russians with carrying out the computer hacking and working with WikiLeaks and other organisations to spread stolen documents. Assange has consistently denied any connection to or co-operation with Russia in relation to the leaks, and accused the Clinton campaign of stoking ""a neo-McCarthy hysteria"".On 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with the Ecuadorian authorities. The police were invited into the embassy, and he was arrested. Later that day, he was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act and on 1 May 2019 he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison in the United Kingdom. On the same day, the United States government unsealed an indictment against Assange for alleged computer intrusion, related to the leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. On 23 May 2019, the United States government further charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Editors from newspapers including The Washington Post and The New York Times criticised the government's decision to charge Assange under the Espionage Act. After having been dropped in 2017, Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation in May 2019, but in November closed it again, saying that the evidence had weakened over time. Assange is incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh, reportedly in ill health.",{4741},1,"['Wikileaks', 'Julian Assange', 'Ecuador', 'Julian Paul Assange', '3 July 1971', 'Australian', 'WikiLeaks', '2006', 'WikiLeaks', '2010', 'U.S. Army', 'Chelsea Manning', 'Baghdad', 'Collateral Murder', 'April 2010', 'Afghanistan', 'July 2010', 'Iraq', 'October 2010', 'November 2010', '2010', 'United States', 'WikiLeaks', 'November 2010', 'Sweden', 'Assange', 'months earlier', 'Sweden', 'the United States', 'American', 'UK', '7 December 2010', 'ten days', 'June 2012', 'the Embassy of Ecuador', 'London', 'Ecuador', 'the United States', 'January 2018', 'Ecuadorian', '2019', 'the Embassy of Ecuador', 'London', 'almost seven years', '2016', 'US Democratic Party', 'WikiLeaks', 'Hillary Clinton', 'State', 'The U.S. Intelligence Community', 'Russian', '2016', 'United States', '2018', 'Russian', 'GRU', 'Robert Mueller', 'Russians', 'WikiLeaks', 'Russia', 'Clinton', 'neo-McCarthy hysteria""', '11 April 2019', 'Assange', 'Ecuadorian', 'Later that day', 'the Bail Act', '1 May 2019', '50 weeks', 'the United Kingdom', 'the same day', 'United States', 'Chelsea Manning', '23 May 2019', 'United States', 'the Espionage Act', '1917', 'The Washington Post', 'The New York Times', 'the Espionage Act', '2017', 'Swedish', 'May 2019', 'November', 'HM']","['NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE']"
1046,2012,November,1,"Scientists detect evidence of light from the universe's first stars, predicted to have formed 500 million years after the big bang",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe,"The observable universe is a spherical region of the universe comprising all matter that can be observed from Earth or its space-based telescopes and exploratory probes at the present time, because electromagnetic radiation from these objects has had time to reach the Solar System and Earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion. There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. Assuming the universe is isotropic, the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly the same in every direction. That is, the observable universe has a spherical volume (a ball) centered on the observer. Every location in the universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.
The word observable in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology to detect light or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the speed of light itself. Because no signals can travel faster than light, any object farther away from us than light could travel in the age of the universe (estimated as of 2015 around 13.799±0.021 billion years) simply cannot be detected, as the signals could not have reached us yet. Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the visible universe, which includes only signals emitted since recombination (when hydrogen atoms were formed from protons and electrons and photons were emitted)—and the observable universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (the Big Bang in traditional physical cosmology, the end of the inflationary epoch in modern cosmology).
According to calculations, the current comoving distance—proper distance, which takes into account that the universe has expanded since the light was emitted—to particles from which the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) was emitted, which represents the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion parsecs (about 45.7 billion light-years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light-years), about 2% larger. The radius of the observable universe is therefore estimated to be about 46.5 billion light-years and its diameter about 28.5 gigaparsecs (93 billion light-years, or 8.8×1026 metres or 2.89×1027 feet) which equals 880 yottameters. The total mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be calculated using the critical density and the diameter of the observable universe to be about 1.5 × 1053 kg. In November 2018, astronomers reported that the extragalactic background light (EBL) amounted to 4 × 1084 photons.As the universe's expansion is accelerating, all currently observable objects will eventually appear to freeze in time, while emitting progressively redder and fainter light. For instance, objects with the current redshift z from 5 to 10 will remain observable for no more than 4–6 billion years. In addition, light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a certain comoving distance (currently about 19 billion parsecs) will never reach Earth.","{2051, 387, 1676, 2317, 3862, 3864, 1821, 2721, 2210, 442, 704, 2645, 603, 3036, 2141, 3803, 1890, 5092, 1136, 2039, 2171, 892}",22,"['500 million years', 'Earth', 'the Solar System and Earth', 'Earth', '2015', 'emitted)—and', 'about 2%', 'about 1.5 ×', 'November 2018', '1084', 'Earth']","['DATE', 'LOC', 'PRODUCT', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERCENT', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'LOC']"
1047,2012,April,9,"""The Lion King"" becomes highest grossing Broadway show after overtaking ""The Phantom of the Opera""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre,"Broadway theatre, also known simply as Broadway, refers to the theatrical performances presented in the 41 professional theatres, each with 500 or more seats, located in the Theater District and Lincoln Center along Broadway, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Broadway and London's West End together represent the highest commercial level of live theater in the English-speaking world.  While the thoroughfare itself has become eponymous with the district and its collection of 41 theatres, only three of the theatres are physically located on Broadway itself (being the Broadway Theatre, the Palace Theatre, and the Winter Garden Theatre), the rest are located on the numbered cross streets extending from the Nederlander Theatre one block south of Times Square on West 41st Street, north along either side of Broadway to the Vivian Beaumont Theater, located outside of the Theater District on West 65th street, with the highest concentration of theaters located between 42nd Street (Times Square) and 49th Street.  While exceptions exist, the term ""Broadway theatre"" is generally reserved for venues with a seating capacity of at least 500 people, smaller theaters are referred to as off-Broadway (regardless of location), while very small venues (less than 100) are called off-off-Broadway, a term that can also apply to non-commercial or avant garde theater, or productions held outside of traditional theater venues.The Theater District is a popular tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the 2018–2019 season (which ended May 26, 2019) total attendance was 14,768,254 and Broadway shows had US$1,829,312,140 in grosses, with attendance up 9.5%, grosses up 10.3%, and playing weeks up 9.3%.The majority of Broadway shows are musicals. Historian Martin Shefter argues that ""'Broadway musicals', culminating in the productions of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, became enormously influential forms of American popular culture"" and contributed to making New York City the cultural capital of the Western Hemisphere.","{4611, 1539, 7, 2568, 524, 528, 3601, 3091, 4115, 34, 4642, 1576, 4671, 1602, 4675, 580, 1616, 4688, 97, 3686, 1640, 4716, 1133, 2169, 4736, 4235, 2702, 2191, 1170, 2210, 3243, 174, 1711, 690, 694, 698, 1235, 4307, 3814, 748, 1272, 3322, 3842, 771, 1795, 3332, 4871, 272, 2322, 290, 2339, 3874, 3365, 1319, 810, 3371, 4400, 1847, 4407, 826, 4413, 3908, 4426, 2891, 4430, 1359, 3413, 4437, 3927, 355, 3427, 4971, 889, 3451, 4990, 3459, 900, 4996, 3978, 2955, 3979, 5010, 403, 2964, 3989, 4501, 1432, 3482, 3999, 4007, 5033, 948, 4020, 1464, 1465, 2489, 4536, 2507, 1997, 4558, 2000, 1491, 2004, 2525}",104,"['The Lion King', 'Broadway', 'The Phantom of the Opera', 'Broadway', 'Broadway', 'the Theater District', 'Lincoln Center', 'Broadway', 'Manhattan', 'New York City', 'Broadway', 'London', 'West End', 'English', 'Broadway', 'the Broadway Theatre', 'the Palace Theatre', 'the Winter Garden Theatre', 'Times Square', 'West 41st Street', 'Broadway', 'the Vivian Beaumont Theater', 'the Theater District', 'West 65th', '42nd Street', 'Times Square', '49th Street', 'Broadway', 'Broadway', 'The Theater District', 'New York City', 'The Broadway League', 'the 2018–2019 season', 'May 26, 2019', 'Broadway', '9.5%', '10.3%', 'weeks', 'Broadway', 'Martin Shefter', 'Broadway', 'Richard Rodgers', 'Oscar Hammerstein', 'American', 'New York City', 'the Western Hemisphere']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'FAC', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LANGUAGE', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'PERCENT', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'LOC']"

1057,2013,January,19,Calcium deposits are discovered on Mars by NASA’s Curiosity Rover,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_on_Mars,"Almost all water on Mars today exists as ice, though it also exists in small quantities as vapor in the atmosphere. What was thought to be low-volume liquid brines in shallow Martian soil, also called recurrent slope lineae, may be grains of flowing sand and dust slipping downhill to make dark streaks. The only place where water ice is visible at the surface is at the north polar ice cap. Abundant water ice is also present beneath the permanent carbon dioxide ice cap at the Martian south pole and in the shallow subsurface at more temperate conditions. More than 21 million km3 of ice have been detected at or near the surface of Mars, enough to cover the whole planet to a depth of 35 meters (115 ft). Even more ice is likely to be locked away in the deep subsurface.Some liquid water may occur transiently on the Martian surface today, but limited to traces of dissolved moisture from the atmosphere and thin films, which are challenging environments for known life. No large standing bodies of liquid water exist on the planet's surface, because the atmospheric pressure there averages just 600 pascals (0.087 psi), a figure slightly below the vapor pressure of water at its melting point; under average Martian conditions, pure water on the Martian surface would freeze or, if heated to above the melting point, would sublime to vapor. Before about 3.8 billion years ago, Mars may have had a denser atmosphere and higher surface temperatures, allowing vast amounts of liquid water on the surface, possibly including a large ocean that may have covered one-third of the planet. Water has also apparently flowed across the surface for short periods at various intervals more recently in Mars' history. Aeolis Palus in Gale Crater, explored by the Curiosity rover, is the geological remains of an ancient freshwater lake that could have been a hospitable environment for microbial life.Many lines of evidence indicate that water ice is abundant on Mars and it has played a significant role in the planet's geologic history. The present-day inventory of water on Mars can be estimated from spacecraft imagery, remote sensing techniques (spectroscopic measurements, radar, etc.), and surface investigations from landers and rovers. Geologic evidence of past water includes enormous outflow channels carved by floods, ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds; and the detection of rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water. Numerous geomorphic features suggest the presence of ground ice (permafrost) and the movement of ice in glaciers, both in the recent past and present. Gullies and slope lineae along cliffs and crater walls suggest that flowing water continues to shape the surface of Mars, although to a far lesser degree than in the ancient past.
Although the surface of Mars was periodically wet and could have been hospitable to microbial life billions of years ago, the current environment at the surface is dry and subfreezing, probably presenting an insurmountable obstacle for living organisms. In addition, Mars lacks a thick atmosphere, ozone layer, and magnetic field, allowing solar and cosmic radiation to strike the surface unimpeded. The damaging effects of ionizing radiation on cellular structure is another one of the prime limiting factors on the survival of life on the surface. Therefore, the best potential locations for discovering life on Mars may be in subsurface environments. Large amounts of underground ice have been found on Mars; the volume of water detected is equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior. In 2018, scientists reported the discovery of a subglacial lake on Mars, 1.5 km (0.93 mi) below the southern polar ice cap, with a horizontal extent of about 20 km (12 mi), the first known stable body of liquid water on the planet.Understanding the extent and situation of water on Mars is vital to assess the planet’s potential for harboring life and for providing usable resources for future human exploration.

1058,2013,February,12,"North Korea allegedly conducts its third nuclear test, saying it was a nuclear device that could be weaponized",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons,"Eight sovereign states have publicly announced successful detonation of nuclear weapons. Five are considered to be nuclear-weapon states (NWS) under the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In order of acquisition of nuclear weapons these are the United States, Russia (the successor state to the Soviet Union), the United Kingdom, France, and China.
Since the NPT entered into force in 1970, three states that were not parties to the Treaty have conducted overt nuclear tests, namely India, Pakistan, and North Korea. North Korea had been a party to the NPT but withdrew in 2003.
Israel is also generally understood to have nuclear weapons, but does not acknowledge it, maintaining a policy of deliberate ambiguity, and is not known definitively to have conducted a nuclear test. Israel is estimated to possess somewhere between 75 and 400 nuclear warheads. One possible motivation for nuclear ambiguity is deterrence with minimum political cost.States that formerly possessed nuclear weapons are South Africa (developed nuclear weapons but then disassembled its arsenal before joining the NPT) and the former Soviet republics of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, whose weapons were repatriated to Russia.
According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the worldwide total inventory of nuclear weapons as of 2019 stood at 13,865, of which 3,750 were deployed with operational forces. In early 2019, more than 90% of the world's 13,865 nuclear weapons were owned by Russia and the United States.","{640, 4993, 4994, 4871, 1931, 2955, 3468, 4235, 3727, 528, 5019, 1566, 4895, 4768, 1058, 2210, 4642, 2856, 4905, 4140, 4785, 563, 565, 1591, 311, 1081, 1979, 2875, 4413, 703, 3777, 452, 964, 4549, 971, 2891, 1997, 3795, 2004, 4307, 5077, 4829, 1502, 608, 3814, 2152, 635, 4971, 370, 632, 3578, 2171, 4605}",53,"['North Korea', 'the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons', 'the United States', 'Russia', 'the Soviet Union', 'the United Kingdom', 'France', 'China', 'NPT', '1970', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'NPT', '2003', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'South Africa', 'NPT', 'Soviet', 'Belarus', 'Kazakhstan', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Stockholm International Peace Research Institute', '2019', 'early 2019', 'more than 90%', 'Russia', 'the United States']","['GPE', 'LAW', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'GPE', 'GPE']"
1059,2013,March,14,Xi Jinping is named as the new President of the People's Republic of China,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China,"The president of the People's Republic of China is the head of state of the People's Republic of China. Under the country's constitution, the presidency is a largely ceremonial office with limited power. However, since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held simultaneously by the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, the top leader in the one party system. The presidency is officially regarded as an institution of the state rather than an administrative post; theoretically, the president serves at the pleasure of the National People's Congress, the legislature, and is not legally vested to take executive action on its own prerogative. The current president is Xi Jinping, who took office in March 2013.
Since 1993, apart from brief periods of transition, the top leader of China simultaneously serves as the president, the leader of the party (as General Secretary), and the commander-in-chief of the military (as the chairman of the Central Military Commission). This individual then carries out different duties under separate titles. For example, the leader meets foreign dignitaries and receives ambassadors in his capacity as President, issues military directives as Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and upholds party rule as the general secretary of the Communist Party of China.
The presidency was first established in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China in 1954 and successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the presidency became vacant. The presidency was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, then reinstated in the Constitution of 1982, but with reduced powers. The official English-language translation of the title was ""Chairman""; after 1982, this translation was changed to ""President"", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.Between 1982 and 2018, the constitution stipulated that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. During the Mao era and also since 2018, there were no term limits attached to this office.",set(),0,"['Xi Jinping', ""the People's Republic of China"", ""the People's Republic of China"", ""the People's Republic of China"", '1993', 'the Communist Party of China', ""the National People's Congress"", 'Xi Jinping', 'March 2013', '1993', 'China', 'the Central Military Commission', 'the Central Military Commission', 'the Communist Party of China', ""the Constitution of the People's Republic of China"", '1954', 'Mao Zedong', 'Liu Shaoqi', 'Liu', 'the Cultural Revolution', 'the Constitution of 1975', 'the Constitution of 1982', 'English', '1982', 'Chinese', 'Between 1982 and 2018', 'Mao', '2018']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'LAW', 'LAW', 'LANGUAGE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE']"
1060,2013,May,16,Human stem cells are successfully cloned,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_cloning,"Human cloning is the creation of a genetically identical copy (or clone) of a human. The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissue. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of identical twins. The possibility of person cloning has raised controversies. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass laws regarding human cloning and its legality.
Two commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, as of April 2020. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are somatic-cell nuclear transfer and, more recently, pluripotent stem cell induction. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.","{2169, 2388}",2,['April 2020'],['DATE']
1061,2013,July,18,"Detroit, Michigan, files for bankruptcy, becoming the largest US municipal bankruptcy ever at $18.5 billion",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit,"Detroit (, locally also ; French: Détroit, lit. 'strait') is the largest and most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the largest U.S. city on the United States–Canada border, and the seat of Wayne County. The municipality of Detroit had a 2018 estimated population of 672,662, making it the 23rd-most populous city in the United States. The metropolitan area, known as Metro Detroit, is home to 4.3 million people, making it the second-largest in the Midwest after the Chicago metropolitan area. Regarded as a major cultural center, Detroit is known for its contributions to music and as a repository for art, architecture and design.Detroit is a major port on the Detroit River, one of the four major straits that connect the Great Lakes system to the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The Detroit Metropolitan Airport is among the most important hubs in the United States. The City of Detroit anchors the second-largest regional economy in the Midwest, behind Chicago and ahead of Minneapolis–Saint Paul, and the 13th-largest in the United States. Detroit and its neighboring Canadian city Windsor are connected through a highway tunnel, railway tunnel, and the Ambassador Bridge, which is the second busiest international crossing in North America, after San Diego–Tijuana. Detroit is best known as the center of the U.S. automobile industry, and the ""Big Three"" auto manufacturers General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler are all headquartered in Metro Detroit.In 1701, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit, the future city of Detroit. During the 19th century, it became an important industrial hub at the center of the Great Lakes region. The city became the 4th-largest in the nation in 1920, after only New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia with the influence of the booming auto industry. With expansion of the auto industry in the early 20th century, the city and its suburbs experienced rapid growth, and by the 1940s, the city had become the fourth-largest in the country. However, due to industrial restructuring, the loss of jobs in the auto industry, and rapid suburbanization, Detroit lost considerable population from the late 20th century to the present. Since reaching a peak of 1.85 million at the 1950 census, Detroit's population has declined by more than 60 percent. In 2013, Detroit became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, which it successfully exited in December 2014, when the city government regained control of Detroit's finances.Detroit's diverse culture has had both local and international influence, particularly in music, with the city giving rise to the genres of Motown and techno, and playing an important role in the development of jazz, hip-hop, rock, and punk music. The rapid growth of Detroit in its boom years resulted in a globally unique stock of architectural monuments and historic places. Since the 2000s conservation efforts have managed to save many architectural pieces and achieved several large-scale revitalizations, including the restoration of several historic theatres and entertainment venues, high-rise renovations, new sports stadiums, and a riverfront revitalization project. More recently, the population of Downtown Detroit, Midtown Detroit, and various other neighborhoods has increased. An increasingly popular tourist destination, Detroit receives 19 million visitors per year. In 2015, Detroit was named a ""City of Design"" by UNESCO, the first U.S. city to receive that designation.","{1539, 2568, 521, 1545, 4113, 2066, 3090, 1562, 2589, 2590, 2078, 1058, 4134, 39, 551, 1576, 2601, 4647, 3630, 1584, 2104, 1081, 3139, 4675, 2119, 3151, 4688, 1622, 2649, 3163, 4192, 3686, 2152, 619, 2155, 3693, 1649, 3186, 2169, 2170, 2682, 3195, 640, 1668, 4235, 2191, 144, 2703, 3727, 154, 4768, 2213, 1204, 694, 2241, 3268, 1739, 2764, 717, 3277, 1235, 3795, 3285, 4307, 4825, 3803, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3303, 4330, 748, 1780, 1783, 1275, 4859, 1795, 4871, 1802, 1292, 1808, 2322, 4895, 290, 294, 4905, 3371, 4916, 311, 4920, 2875, 4923, 4413, 4924, 3903, 1856, 2379, 4430, 4942, 2388, 4437, 3927, 4445, 4957, 1888, 3427, 4967, 874, 1386, 4971, 4472, 3451, 4993, 3970, 3459, 900, 4994, 2955, 3979, 403, 2964, 3989, 1432, 5019, 5033, 3500, 4014, 434, 948, 3508, 1464, 4024, 4536, 1979, 5059, 452, 4549, 1483, 2507, 1997, 2508, 4558, 2004, 5079, 5080, 3034, 987, 1502, 3040, 5088, 5092, 3046, 492, 4589, 5107, 2040, 3578, 4605}",158,"['Detroit', 'Michigan', 'US', 'Detroit', 'French', 'Détroit', 'U.S.', 'Michigan', 'U.S.', 'the United States', 'Canada', 'Wayne County', 'Detroit', '2018', 'the United States', 'Metro Detroit', 'Midwest', 'Chicago', 'Detroit', 'Detroit', 'the Detroit River', 'Great Lakes', 'the Saint Lawrence Seaway', 'The Detroit Metropolitan Airport', 'the United States', 'The City of Detroit', 'Midwest', 'Chicago', 'Minneapolis', 'Saint Paul', 'the United States', 'Detroit', 'Canadian', 'North America', 'San Diego', 'Tijuana', 'Detroit', 'U.S.', 'General Motors', 'Ford', 'Fiat Chrysler', 'Metro Detroit', '1701', 'Antoine de la', 'Cadillac', 'Fort Pontchartrain', 'Détroit', 'Detroit', 'the 19th century', 'the Great Lakes', '1920', 'New York City', 'Chicago', 'Philadelphia', 'the early 20th century', 'the 1940s', 'Detroit', 'the late 20th century', '1950', 'Detroit', 'more than 60 percent', '2013', 'Detroit', 'U.S.', 'December 2014', 'Detroit', 'Detroit', 'Motown', 'Detroit', '2000s', 'Detroit', 'Detroit', 'Detroit', '2015', 'Detroit', 'UNESCO', 'U.S.']","['GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE']"

() is an American media-services provider and production company headquartered in Los Gatos, California, founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. The company's primary business is its subscription-based streaming service which offers online streaming of a library of films and television programs, including those produced in-house. As of April 2019, Netflix had over 148 million paid subscriptions worldwide, including 60 million in the United States, and over 154 million subscriptions total including free trials. It is available worldwide except in mainland China (due to local restrictions), Syria, North Korea, and Crimea (due to U.S. sanctions). The company also has offices in India, Netherlands, Brazil, Japan, and South Korea. Netflix is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).
Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental by mail, but Hastings abandoned the sales about a year after the company's founding to focus on the initial DVD rental business. Netflix expanded its business in 2010 with the introduction of streaming media while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental business. The company expanded internationally in 2010 with streaming available in Canada, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series House of Cards.
Since 2012, Netflix has taken more of an active role as producer and distributor for both film and television series, and to that end, it offers a variety of ""Netflix Original"" content through its online library. By January 2016, Netflix services operated in more than 190 countries. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series and films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel. Their efforts to produce new content, secure the rights for additional content, and diversify through 190 countries have resulted in the company racking up billions in debt: $21.9 billion as of September 2017, up from $16.8 billion from the previous year. $6.5 billion of this is long-term debt, while the remaining is in long-term obligations. In October 2018, Netflix announced it would raise another $2 billion in debt to help fund new content.As of March 2020, Netflix offered just under 3,000 film titles for streaming on its U.S. service. This does not include multi-episode titles (series).","{1026, 4611, 2051, 7, 2568, 528, 3090, 2590, 1566, 2082, 4642, 4643, 38, 4134, 1576, 2092, 4140, 1584, 565, 4661, 1591, 2104, 1081, 4671, 595, 1622, 2649, 2141, 608, 612, 2152, 3692, 1133, 1649, 4722, 3702, 2169, 2171, 128, 640, 4235, 2703, 3727, 1177, 4768, 2210, 2214, 3243, 3244, 1711, 176, 4785, 2240, 2241, 3777, 1222, 1228, 1742, 2258, 3795, 4307, 4825, 4829, 3814, 748, 1260, 1272, 3322, 3842, 1795, 4871, 2830, 4883, 4895, 290, 1319, 1832, 2856, 4905, 1323, 4400, 2355, 310, 311, 1847, 4407, 826, 2875, 4413, 2891, 4944, 3413, 4437, 1370, 2398, 1888, 4971, 370, 889, 1403, 3451, 4990, 4993, 4994, 3459, 900, 901, 903, 1931, 2955, 3468, 3979, 1938, 5010, 1432, 5022, 2982, 4006, 4007, 5033, 4526, 1455, 2483, 1979, 5052, 3520, 4545, 1475, 452, 3524, 4549, 968, 971, 2507, 4558, 4561, 981, 5077, 4056, 2529, 2018, 5097, 3578, 4605}",144,"['Orange Is the New Black', 'Netflix', 'Taylor Schilling', 'Netflix, Inc.', 'American', 'Los Gatos', 'California', '1997', 'Reed Hastings', 'Marc Randolph', 'Scotts Valley', 'California', 'April 2019', 'Netflix', 'the United States', 'China', 'Syria', 'North Korea', 'Crimea', 'U.S.', 'India', 'Netherlands', 'Brazil', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Netflix', 'the Motion Picture Association', 'Netflix', 'Hastings', 'about a year', 'DVD', '2010', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', '2010', 'Canada', 'Latin America', 'Caribbean', '2013', 'House of Cards', '2012', 'Netflix', 'Netflix Original', 'January 2016', 'Netflix', '2016', 'September 2017', 'the previous year', 'October 2018', 'Netflix', 'March 2020', 'Netflix', 'U.S.']","['WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE']"

1074,2013,June,7,Russian President Vladimir Putin announces his divorce from his wife on national TV,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin,"Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin (; Russian: Влади́мир Влади́мирович Пу́тин, romanized: Vladimir Vladimirovič Putin, Russian pronunciation: [vɫɐˈdʲimʲɪr vɫɐˈdʲimʲɪrəvʲɪtɕ ˈputʲɪn]; born 7 October 1952) is a Russian politician who has served as the President of Russia since 2012, previously holding the position from 1999 until 2008. He was also the Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012.
Putin was born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) and studied law at Leningrad State University, graduating in 1975. Putin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, before resigning in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. He later moved to Moscow in 1996 to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin, serving first as Director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the KGB's successor agency, before being appointed as prime minister in August 1999. After the resignation of Yeltsin, Putin was elected in 2000 to succeed him.
During his first tenure as president, the Russian economy grew for eight straight years, with GDP measured by purchasing power increasing by 72%. The growth was a result of the 2000s commodities boom, recovery from the post-Communist depression and financial crises, and prudent economic and fiscal policies. After serving as prime minister under Dmitry Medvedev from 2008 to 2012, Putin announced he would seek a third term as president and won the March 2012 election with 64% of the vote. Falling oil prices coupled with international sanctions imposed at the beginning of 2014 after Russia's annexation of Crimea and military intervention in Eastern Ukraine led to GDP shrinking by 3.7% in 2015, though the Russian economy rebounded in 2016 with 0.3% GDP growth, and the recession officially ended. Putin gained 76% of the March 2018 election vote and was re-elected for a six-year term that will end in 2024.
Under Putin's leadership, Russia has experienced democratic backsliding. Experts do not generally consider Russia to be a democracy, citing purges and jailing of political opponents, curtailed press freedom, and the lack of free and fair elections. Russia has scored poorly on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index and Freedom House's Freedom in the World index (including a record low 20/100 rating in the 2017 Freedom in the World report, a rating not given since the time of the Soviet Union). Human rights organizations and activists have accused Putin of persecuting political critics and activists as well as ordering them tortured or assassinated; he has rejected accusations of human rights abuses. Officials of the United States government have accused him of leading an interference program against Hillary Clinton in support of Donald Trump during the U.S. presidential election in 2016, an allegation which both Trump and Putin have frequently denied and criticized.","{2051, 7, 524, 3090, 1058, 4134, 1584, 4661, 2104, 2112, 1095, 2119, 4682, 595, 1622, 2649, 2141, 2152, 1130, 1646, 1136, 1649, 4722, 2169, 2682, 2171, 127, 640, 4224, 4235, 1678, 2703, 144, 1168, 1170, 3727, 1177, 4768, 3752, 3243, 684, 174, 4785, 182, 2241, 2242, 1739, 3795, 4307, 4824, 3803, 4829, 3812, 3813, 4330, 1260, 3322, 4352, 3842, 3348, 3862, 4895, 290, 3874, 4905, 3371, 1847, 2875, 4924, 4413, 2891, 4430, 2388, 3413, 3927, 4445, 1888, 865, 1890, 873, 3434, 4971, 1388, 3443, 4472, 889, 3451, 892, 4993, 4994, 387, 1925, 2439, 2955, 3979, 3989, 1432, 3490, 2475, 4526, 2483, 4020, 4024, 1979, 4539, 452, 964, 3524, 4549, 2507, 1997, 467, 2004, 981, 4051, 5077, 5080, 1502, 5092, 3564, 4589, 2039, 2040, 3578, 4605}",125,"['Russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin', 'Russian', 'Vladimir Vladimirovič Putin', 'Russian', '7 October 1952', 'Russian', 'Russia', '2012', '1999', '2008', 'Russia', '1999 to 2000', '2008', '2012', 'Putin', 'Leningrad', 'Saint Petersburg', 'Leningrad State University', '1975', 'Putin', 'KGB', '16 years', 'Lieutenant Colonel', '1991', 'Saint Petersburg', 'Moscow', '1996', 'Boris Yeltsin', 'the Federal Security Service', 'KGB', 'August 1999', 'Yeltsin', 'Putin', '2000', 'Russian', 'eight straight years', '72%', 'post-Communist', 'Dmitry Medvedev', '2008', '2012', 'Putin', 'March 2012', '64%', 'the beginning of 2014', 'Russia', 'Crimea', 'Eastern Ukraine', '3.7%', '2015', 'Russian', '2016', '0.3%', 'Putin', '76%', 'March 2018', 'six-year', '2024', 'Putin', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Russia', ""Transparency International's"", 'Corruption Perceptions Index', ""the Economist Intelligence Unit's"", ""Freedom House's"", 'World', 'the 2017 Freedom', 'World', 'the Soviet Union', 'Putin', 'United States', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'U.S.', '2016', 'Trump', 'Putin']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'PERSON', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON']"

The government of Yanukovych was negotiating an association agreement with the European Union since 2012. Such comprehensive trade agreement with the EU would have impacted Ukraine's trade agreements with Russia, the latter being Ukraine's biggest trade partner at the time. Yanukovych believed that the complications could be addressed, and he said that he intended to enter the agreement, but continued to postpone. This was interpreted as an attempt to back out of signing this agreement, and led to a wave of protests which came to be known as the ""Euromaidan"" movement. Clashes between the protestors and the riot police became violent, and resulted in deaths of nearly 130 people, including 18 police officers. As the tensions rose, the personal safety for the president became untenable; on 22 February he fled from Kiev to Russia. The protesters proceeded to take control of the government. On the same day, the parliament declared that Yanukovych was relieved of duty in a 328-to-0 vote.Yanukovych said that this vote was illegal and possibly coerced, and asked Russian Federation for assistance. Russia considered the overthrow of Yanukovych to be an illegal coup, and did not recognize the interim government that was put in place by the protesters. Widespread protests against the revolution occurred in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, where Yanukovych received strong support in the 2010 presidential election. These protests escalated into 2014 Crimean status referendum, Russian military intervention, and the establishment of de facto independent states in Donetsk and Luhansk.
The interim government, led by Arseniy Yatsenyuk, proceeded to sign the EU association agreement. Petro Poroshenko became the president of Ukraine after a landslide victory in the unscheduled 2014 presidential elections. The new government restored the 2004 amendments to the Ukrainian constitution that were controversially repealed as unconstitutional in 2010, and initiated a large-scale purge of civil servants who were associated with the overthrown regime. The Law on Regional Languages, which allowed Ukrainian regions with large cultural minorities to use their own languages in their local administration, was repealed.

The annexation from Ukraine followed a Russian military intervention in Crimea that took place in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and was part of wider unrest across southern and eastern Ukraine.On 22–23 February 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin convened an all-night meeting with security service chiefs to discuss the extrication of the deposed Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych. At the end of the meeting, Putin remarked that ""we must start working on returning Crimea to Russia"". On 23 February, pro-Russian demonstrations were held in the Crimean city of Sevastopol. On 27 February, masked Russian troops without insignia took over the Supreme Council (parliament) of Crimea and captured strategic sites across Crimea, which led to the installation of the pro-Russian Aksyonov government in Crimea, the conducting of the Crimean status referendum and the declaration of Crimea's independence on 16 March 2014. Russia formally incorporated Crimea as two federal subjects of the Russian Federation with effect from 18 March 2014.Ukraine and many other countries condemned the annexation and consider it to be a violation of international law and Russian-signed agreements safeguarding the territorial integrity of Ukraine, including the 1991 Belavezha Accords that established the Commonwealth of Independent States, the 1975 Helsinki Accords, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances and the 1997 Treaty on friendship, cooperation and partnership between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. It led to the other members of the then G8 suspending Russia from the group then introducing a first round of sanctions against the country. The United Nations General Assembly also rejected the vote and annexation, adopting a resolution affirming the ""territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders"". The UN resolution also ""underscores that the referendum having no validity, cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of [Crimea]"" and called upon all states and international organizations not to recognize or to imply the recognition of Russia's annexation. In 2016, the UN General Assembly reaffirmed non-recognition of the annexation and condemned ""the temporary occupation of part of the territory of Ukraine—the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol"".The Russian Federation opposes the ""annexation"" label, with Putin defending the referendum as complying with the principle of self-determination of peoples.

1081,2014,June,11,Islamic State of Iraq forces seize control of government offices and other important buildings in the northern city of Mosul,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Iraq,"History of Iraq
Iraq is the name of the state that currently partially encompasses the territory of the civilization of ancient Mesopotamia. This civilization came into being between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. These rivers flow into the Persian Gulf, through the State of Iraq. The Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq, also known as Mandatory Iraq in its early phase, was established by the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1922 resulting from the 1920 Iraqi revolt against British rule. It is centered in Lower Mesopotamia (corresponding to historical Babylonia, later also known as ʿIrāq-i ʿArab) but also includes part of Upper Mesopotamia and of the Syrian Desert and the Arabian Desert. The history of this area has witnessed some of the world's earliest writing, literature, sciences, mathematics, laws and philosophies; hence its common epithet, the Cradle of Civilization.
As part of the larger Fertile Crescent, Mesopotamia saw the earliest emergence of civilization in the Neolithic (the Ubaid period) Age and formed a significant part of the Ancient Near East throughout the Bronze Age and the Iron Age (Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian). After the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Mesopotamia fell under Persian and then Greek rule. By the 3rd century, when it was once again under Persian (Sassanid) control, the earlier population was increasingly displaced by Arabs, and the Arabic name al-ʿIrāq dates to about this time. The Sassanid Empire was destroyed by the Islamic conquests and displaced by the Rashidun Caliphate in the 7th century. Baghdad became the center of the  ""Islamic Golden Age"" under the Abbasid Caliphate during the 9th century. Baghdad's rapid growth stagnated in the 10th century due to the Buwayhid and Seljuq invasions, but it remained of central importance until the Mongol invasion of 1258. After this, Iraq became a province of the Turco-Mongol Ilkhanate and declined in importance. After the disintegration of the Ilkhanate, Iraq was ruled by the  Jalairids and Kara Koyunlu until its eventual absorption into the  Ottoman Empire  in the 16th century, intermittently falling under Iranian Safavid and Mamluk control.
Ottoman rule ended with World War I, and the British Empire administered Iraq as Mandatory Iraq until the establishment of the Kingdom of Iraq in 1933. A republic formed in 1958 following a coup d'état. Saddam Hussein governed from 1979 to 2003, into which period fall the Iran–Iraq War and the Gulf War. Saddam Hussein was deposed following the 2003 US-led invasion of the country. Over the following years, Iraq came to the brink of civil war, and the situation deteriorated after the withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011. By 2015, Iraq was effectively divided, the central and southern part being controlled by the government, the northwest by the Kurdistan Regional Government and the western part by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. ISIS was expelled from Iraq in 2017, but continued fighting in an insurgency.","{2051, 2052, 4101, 7, 2568, 521, 1041, 3090, 4113, 1557, 1049, 3613, 2589, 2078, 1058, 4134, 4647, 1576, 2601, 3630, 561, 4682, 1616, 4688, 3154, 595, 1622, 3671, 3163, 2141, 2150, 2152, 619, 2155, 3693, 1646, 1136, 625, 1649, 2169, 2170, 2682, 3195, 2684, 127, 640, 2176, 131, 1678, 2703, 144, 3727, 1177, 4768, 2210, 3243, 1709, 202, 1739, 2764, 717, 3277, 3795, 4307, 3285, 4313, 3803, 3804, 3805, 3808, 4832, 3812, 3813, 3303, 4330, 2798, 1783, 3322, 1275, 3842, 4879, 1808, 3862, 3869, 4895, 1824, 3365, 294, 4905, 4916, 309, 311, 4920, 2875, 3903, 4937, 2891, 4940, 4430, 4942, 2388, 3413, 1880, 4445, 1888, 1890, 358, 1386, 4971, 1388, 4472, 889, 3451, 892, 4990, 4993, 3970, 387, 900, 3460, 4994, 3978, 2955, 3979, 401, 1938, 3989, 1432, 3490, 4014, 2483, 4024, 1979, 4539, 5059, 452, 964, 3524, 4549, 5065, 2507, 2508, 1997, 1486, 5067, 2000, 467, 2004, 4051, 4563, 5077, 3544, 5079, 3034, 5080, 1502, 3040, 5092, 492, 3564, 4589, 5106, 5107, 2040, 4605}",165,"['Islamic', 'Mosul', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Mesopotamia', 'Tigris', 'the Persian Gulf', 'the State of Iraq', 'The Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq', 'Mandatory Iraq', 'Anglo', '1922', '1920', 'Iraqi', 'British', 'Lower Mesopotamia', 'Babylonia', 'ʿIrāq', 'ʿArab', 'Upper Mesopotamia', 'the Syrian Desert', 'the Arabian Desert', 'Fertile Crescent', 'Mesopotamia', 'Neolithic', 'Ubaid', 'the Bronze Age', 'Sumerian', 'Akkadian', 'Babylonian', 'Assyrian', 'Mesopotamia', 'Persian', 'Greek', 'the 3rd century', 'Persian', 'Sassanid', 'Arabs', 'Arabic', 'al-ʿIrāq', 'The Sassanid Empire', 'Islamic', 'the Rashidun Caliphate', 'the 7th century', 'Baghdad', 'the 9th century', 'Baghdad', 'the 10th century', 'Mongol', '1258', 'Iraq', 'Ilkhanate', 'Iraq', 'Jalairids', 'Kara Koyunlu', 'Ottoman', 'the 16th century', 'Iranian', 'Safavid', 'Mamluk', 'Ottoman', 'World War I', 'British', 'Empire', 'Iraq', 'Mandatory', 'the Kingdom of Iraq', '1933', '1958', 'Saddam Hussein', '1979', '2003', 'Iran', 'Iraq War', 'the Gulf War', 'Saddam Hussein', '2003', 'US', 'the following years', 'Iraq', 'U.S.', '2011', '2015', 'Iraq', 'the Kurdistan Regional Government', 'the Islamic State of Iraq', 'Levant', 'ISIS', 'Iraq', '2017']","['NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'LOC', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'DATE']"
1082,2014,July,17,"Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 is shot down over Eastern Ukraine by a Buk surface-to-air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew on board",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17,"Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) was a scheduled passenger flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur that was shot down on 17 July 2014 while flying over eastern Ukraine. All 283 passengers and 15 crew were killed. Contact with the aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was lost when it was about 50 km (31 mi) from the Ukraine–Russia border, and wreckage of the aircraft fell near Hrabove in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, 40 km (25 mi) from the border. It was Malaysia Airlines' second aircraft loss during 2014, after the disappearance of Flight 370 on 8 March. The shoot-down occurred in the War in Donbass, during the Battle in Shakhtarsk Raion, in an area controlled by pro-Russian rebels. The Ukrainian Air Force had suffered losses from increasingly sophisticated air defence weaponry. 
The responsibility for investigation was delegated to the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) and the Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT), who concluded that the airliner was downed by a Buk surface-to-air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine. According to the JIT, the Buk that was used originated from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Federation and had been transported from Russia on the day of the crash, fired from a field in a rebel-controlled area and returned to Russia afterwards. On the basis of the JIT's conclusions, the governments of the Netherlands and Australia held Russia responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation and were pursuing legal routes to formalise this as of May 2018. The Russian government denied involvement in the shooting down of the plane, and holds the Ukrainian government at fault for allowing civilian flights in a war zone. Immediately after contact with the aircraft was lost, the rebel militia in Donetsk claimed to have shot down a Ukrainian An-26 military transporter. When it became apparent that the wreckage that fell near Hrabove was from a civilian airliner, the separatists withdrew this claim and denied shooting down any aircraft.The findings by the DSB and JIT are consistent with the earlier claims by American and German intelligence sources and claims by the Ukrainian government.

The Seahawks defeated the Broncos 43–8, the largest margin of victory for an underdog and tied for the third largest point differential overall (35) in Super Bowl history with Super Bowl XXVII (1993). It was the first time the winning team scored over 40 points, while holding their opponent to under 10. This became the first Super Bowl victory for the Seahawks and the fifth Super Bowl loss for the Broncos, tied with the New England Patriots for the most of any team. The game was played on February 2, 2014 at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the first Super Bowl played outdoors in a cold-weather city and the first Super Bowl to be played on February 2.This marked the third time the number one seed from each conference met in the league championship, joining Super Bowl XXVIII (1994) and Super Bowl XLIV (2010). The Seahawks posted a 13–3 record and were making their second Super Bowl appearance in eight years. The Broncos were making their seventh Super Bowl appearance after also posting a 13–3 record. The game also featured the league's top offense (Denver) against the top defense (Seattle), the first time this occurred since Super Bowl XXXVII (2003). This also marked the only time that two former divisional rivals met in a Super Bowl, as the Seahawks and Broncos were in the same division from 1977 to 2001.
Seattle built a 22–0 halftime lead, and then a 36–0 advantage before allowing Denver's first and only score on the final play of the third quarter. The Seahawks defense scored a safety on the first play from scrimmage (coincidentally, the final play from scrimmage of the previous Super Bowl was also a safety), the quickest score in Super Bowl history at 12 seconds. They also became the first team in a Super Bowl to score on a safety, a kickoff return for a touchdown (12 seconds into the second half), and an interception return for a touchdown. The Broncos were held to almost 30 points below their scoring average. Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, a five-time NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award winner, threw two interceptions in the first half. Seahawks linebacker Malcolm Smith, who returned one of those interceptions 69 yards for a touchdown, recovered a fumble and made nine tackles, was named Super Bowl MVP.In the United States, the game was televised by Fox; with an average audience of 111.5 million viewers, and peaking at 115.3 million during the halftime show featuring Bruno Mars, the game was briefly the most-watched U.S. television broadcast of all time, until it was surpassed the following year. The game's inaugural Spanish-language telecast on Fox Deportes was also the highest-rated Spanish-language cable telecast outside of soccer.","{1025, 2051, 387, 1678, 3862, 1432, 1048, 4890, 157, 4768, 4134, 4007, 4395, 2483, 1847, 826, 4539, 2875, 3520, 3909, 1990, 967, 968, 4549, 2122, 971, 1739, 2507, 4430, 4682, 4815, 5074, 595, 467, 981, 4825, 3803, 2141, 1890, 2018, 3812, 873, 1388, 3180, 1646, 1136, 4474, 4221}",48,"['Super Bowl XLVIII', 'MetLife Stadium', 'East Rutherford', 'Seattle Seahawks', 'Denver Broncos', 'Malcolm Smith', 'Seattle', 'LB', 'Super Bowl XLVIII', 'American', 'the American Football Conference', 'AFC', 'Denver Broncos', 'National Football Conference', 'Seattle Seahawks', 'the National Football League', 'NFL', 'the 2013 season', 'Seahawks', 'Broncos', 'Super Bowl', 'Super Bowl XXVII', '1993', 'under 10', 'Super Bowl', 'Seahawks', 'Super Bowl', 'Broncos', 'the New England Patriots', 'February 2, 2014', 'MetLife Stadium', 'the Meadowlands Sports Complex', 'East Rutherford', 'New Jersey', 'Super Bowl', 'the first Super Bowl', 'February', 'Super Bowl XXVIII', '1994', 'Super Bowl XLIV', '2010', 'Seahawks', 'Super Bowl', 'eight years', 'Broncos', 'Super Bowl', 'Denver', 'Seattle', 'Super Bowl XXXVII', '2003', 'a Super Bowl', 'Seahawks', 'Broncos', '1977 to 2001', 'Seattle', 'Denver', 'the third quarter', 'Seahawks', 'the previous Super Bowl', 'Super Bowl', 'a Super Bowl', 'the second half', 'Broncos', 'Peyton Manning', 'the first half', 'Seahawks', 'Malcolm Smith', 'Super Bowl', 'the United States', 'Fox', 'Bruno Mars', 'U.S.', 'the following year', 'Spanish', 'Fox Deportes', 'Spanish']","['EVENT', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LANGUAGE', 'ORG', 'LANGUAGE']"

The game's inaugural Spanish-language telecast on Fox Deportes was also the highest-rated Spanish-language cable telecast outside of soccer.","{1025, 2051, 387, 1678, 3862, 1432, 1048, 4890, 157, 4768, 4134, 4007, 4395, 2483, 1847, 826, 4539, 2875, 3520, 3909, 1990, 967, 968, 4549, 2122, 971, 1739, 2507, 4430, 4682, 4815, 5074, 595, 467, 981, 4825, 3803, 2141, 1890, 2018, 3812, 873, 1388, 3180, 1646, 1136, 4474, 4221}",48,"['Super Bowl XLVIII', 'MetLife Stadium', 'East Rutherford', 'Seattle Seahawks', 'Denver Broncos', 'Malcolm Smith', 'Seattle', 'LB', 'Super Bowl XLVIII', 'American', 'the American Football Conference', 'AFC', 'Denver Broncos', 'National Football Conference', 'Seattle Seahawks', 'the National Football League', 'NFL', 'the 2013 season', 'Seahawks', 'Broncos', 'Super Bowl', 'Super Bowl XXVII', '1993', 'under 10', 'Super Bowl', 'Seahawks', 'Super Bowl', 'Broncos', 'the New England Patriots', 'February 2, 2014', 'MetLife Stadium', 'the Meadowlands Sports Complex', 'East Rutherford', 'New Jersey', 'Super Bowl', 'the first Super Bowl', 'February', 'Super Bowl XXVIII', '1994', 'Super Bowl XLIV', '2010', 'Seahawks', 'Super Bowl', 'eight years', 'Broncos', 'Super Bowl', 'Denver', 'Seattle', 'Super Bowl XXXVII', '2003', 'a Super Bowl', 'Seahawks', 'Broncos', '1977 to 2001', 'Seattle', 'Denver', 'the third quarter', 'Seahawks', 'the previous Super Bowl', 'Super Bowl', 'a Super Bowl', 'the second half', 'Broncos', 'Peyton Manning', 'the first half', 'Seahawks', 'Malcolm Smith', 'Super Bowl', 'the United States', 'Fox', 'Bruno Mars', 'U.S.', 'the following year', 'Spanish', 'Fox Deportes', 'Spanish']","['EVENT', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'PRODUCT', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'LANGUAGE', 'ORG', 'LANGUAGE']"

In March 2016, Barack Obama became the first U.S. President to visit Cuba since 1928.On December 17, 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced the beginning of the process of normalizing relations between Cuba and the United States. The normalization agreement was secretly negotiated in preceding months, facilitated by Pope Francis and largely hosted by the Government of Canada. Meetings were held in both Canada and the Vatican City. The agreement would see the lifting of some U.S. travel restrictions, fewer restrictions on remittances, U.S. banks' access to the Cuban financial system, and the reopening of the U.S. embassy in Havana and the Cuban embassy in Washington, which both closed in 1961 after the breakup of diplomatic relations as a result of Cuba's close alliance with the USSR.On April 14, 2015, the Obama administration announced that Cuba would be removed from the United States State Sponsors of Terrorism list. With no congressional action to block this within the permitted time period, Cuba was officially removed from the list on May 29, 2015. This marked a further departure by the United States from the Cold War conflict and its strain on Cuba–United States relations. On July 20, 2015, the Cuban and U.S. ""interests sections"" in Washington and Havana were upgraded to embassies.On June 16, 2017, President Donald Trump stated that he was ""canceling"" the Obama administration's deals with Cuba, while also expressing that a new deal could be negotiated between the Cuban and United States governments.On November 8, 2017, it was announced that some travel restrictions which were loosened by the Obama administration would resume, and that fresh restrictions would be imposed on ""direct financial transactions"" with certain businesses belonging to the Cuban armed forces and interior ministries and would go into effect on November 9.

The first years of the 21st century were marked by the rise of a global economy and Third World consumerism, mistrust in government, deepening global concern over terrorism and an increase in private enterprise. Effects of global warming and rising sea levels continued, with eight islands disappearing between 2007 and 2014. The Arab Spring of the early 2010s led to mixed outcomes in the Arab world, resulting in several civil wars and governments overthrown.

1096,2015,October,29,China announces the end of their one-child policy after 35 years,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy,"The one-child policy was part of a birth planning program designed to control the size of the rapidly growing population of the People's Republic of China. Distinct from the family planning policies of most other countries, which focus on providing contraceptive options to help women have the number of children they want, it set a limit on the number of births parents could have, making it the world's most extreme example of population planning. It was introduced in 1979 (after a decade-long two-child policy), modified beginning in the mid 1980s to allow rural parents a second child if the first was a daughter, and then lasted three more decades before the government announced in late 2015 a reversion back to a two-child limit. The policy also allowed exceptions for some other groups, including ethnic minorities. Thus, the term ""one-child policy"" has been called a ""misnomer"", because for nearly 30 of the 36 years that it existed (1979–2015), about half of all parents in China were allowed to have a second child.To enforce existing birth limits (of one or two children), provincial governments could, and did, require the use of contraception, abortion, and sterilization to ensure compliance, and imposed enormous fines for violations.  Local and national governments created commissions to promote the program and monitor compliance.  China also rewarded families with one child, in accordance with the instructions on further family planning issued by the CPC central committee and the state council in that year, regulations awarded 5 yuan per month for families with one child. Parents who had only one child would also get a ""one-child glory certificate"".The impact of China's birth restrictions has been hotly debated.  According to its government, 400 million births were prevented.  That statistic originally referred to all births averted since 1970, although later it referred to just the one child era beginning around 1980.  Some scholars have disputed the official estimates.  They claim that the one child program had little effect on birth rates or the size of the total population when one considers the large drop in fertility during the two-child decade preceding it and that other countries  – such as Thailand and the Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu - experienced notable fertility declines without official birth quotas. A recent study even suggests that, contrary to popular belief and its government's intentions, the one-child phase of the birth program had a pronatal effect that raised birth rates above what they otherwise would have been. Yet this study has itself been disputed as an implausible ""erasure of the impact of this program from history. Moreover, the comparative models proposed by those dismissing official estimates as exaggerations imply that, even when China's rapid development is considered, its birth program since 1970 has already averted at least 600 million births, a number projected to grow to one billion or more by 2060 given the averted descendants of the births originally averted by policy. The real dispute concerns what portion of that massive number of averted births (and population) should be attributed to the tightened one-child limits (and related enforcements) after 1980, as opposed to the two-child program that preceded it.","{387, 3979, 1931, 2955, 3989, 1177, 5019, 28, 4642, 2982, 1576, 1960, 3243, 4140, 1709, 4526, 4785, 563, 2483, 565, 4661, 1591, 311, 1081, 2682, 1979, 3524, 4430, 4051, 2388, 3413, 854, 4307, 1370, 2141, 4829, 608, 1888, 5092, 3813, 3814, 4074, 4971, 3692, 4589, 1646, 1017, 3578, 892, 4605, 127}",51,"['China', '35 years', ""the People's Republic of China"", '1979', 'the mid 1980s', 'late 2015', 'the 36 years', 'China', 'Local', 'China', 'CPC', 'the state council', 'that year', 'China', '1970', '1980', 'Thailand', 'Indian', 'Kerala', 'China', '1970', '2060', '1980']","['GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE']"
1097,2015,December,12,COP21 climate change summit in Paris reaches a deal between 195 countries to limit the rise in the global average temperature to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement,"The Paris Agreement (French: L'accord de Paris) is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), dealing with greenhouse-gas-emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance, signed in 2016. The agreement's language was negotiated by representatives of 196 state parties at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC in Le Bourget, near Paris, France, and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015. As of February 2020, all UNFCCC members have signed the agreement, 189 have become party to it, and the only significant emitters which are not parties are Iran and Turkey.
The Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels; and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 °C, recognizing that this would substantially reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. This should be done by peaking emissions as soon as possible, in order to ""achieve a  balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases""  in the second half of the 21st century. It also aims to increase the ability of parties to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change, and make ""finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.""
Under the Paris Agreement, each country must determine, plan, and regularly report on the contribution that it undertakes to mitigate global warming. No mechanism forces a country to set a specific emissions target by a specific date, but each target should go beyond previously set targets. In June 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the agreement.

The film was directed by Pete Docter and co-directed by Ronnie del Carmen, with a screenplay written by Docter, Meg LeFauve, and Josh Cooley, adapted from a story by Docter and del Carmen. The film is set in the mind of a young girl named Riley (Kaitlyn Dias), where five personified emotions—Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling)—try to lead her through life as she and her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) adjust to their new surroundings after moving from Minnesota to San Francisco.
Docter first began developing Inside Out in 2010, after noticing changes in his daughter's personality as she grew older. The film's producers consulted numerous psychologists including Dacher Keltner from the University of California, Berkeley, who helped revise the story by emphasizing the neuropsychological findings that human emotions affect interpersonal relationships and can be significantly moderated by them.After premiering at the 68th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2015, Inside Out was released in North America on June 19, 2015, accompanied by the short film Lava. The film was praised for its concept, screenplay, subject matter, Michael Giacchino's musical score, and the vocal performances (particularly those of Poehler, Smith, Black, and Richard Kind). The film grossed $90.4 million in its first weekend, making it the highest opening for an original title at the time, accumulating over $857 million in worldwide box office revenue in 2015, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2015. The film received several awards, including a BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, Critics' Choice Award, Annie Award, Satellite Award, and Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.","{640, 4993, 3842, 1795, 3459, 901, 3970, 7, 2568, 4611, 3978, 2955, 2703, 3727, 531, 3989, 1432, 4895, 4768, 1058, 4134, 4007, 1576, 4994, 4140, 815, 176, 1847, 2104, 4024, 826, 2875, 4539, 4920, 4671, 452, 4549, 1222, 967, 968, 1990, 4682, 971, 2507, 2508, 3322, 2258, 595, 2388, 3154, 1622, 3666, 3795, 4056, 4307, 5077, 5080, 889, 2018, 5092, 997, 4967, 4971, 748, 4589, 1649, 629, 2169, 4474, 3451, 4605, 4990}",72,"['Pixar', 'Inside Out', 'Amy Poehler', 'Phyllis Smith', 'Lewis Black', 'Bill Hader', 'Mindy Kaling', '2015', 'American', '3D', 'Pixar Animation Studios', 'Walt Disney Pictures', 'Pete Docter', 'Ronnie del Carmen', 'Docter', 'Meg LeFauve', 'Josh Cooley', 'Docter', 'Riley', 'Kaitlyn Dias', 'Amy Poehler', 'Sadness', 'Phyllis Smith', 'Lewis Black', 'Bill Hader', 'Disgust', 'Mindy', 'Diane Lane', 'Kyle MacLachlan', 'Minnesota', 'San Francisco', 'Inside Out', '2010', 'Dacher Keltner', 'the University of California, Berkeley', 'Cannes Film Festival', 'May 18, 2015', 'Inside Out', 'North America', 'June 19, 2015', ""Michael Giacchino's"", 'Poehler, Smith', 'Richard Kind', 'its first weekend', '2015', '2015', 'Golden Globe Award,', 'Annie Award', 'Satellite Award', 'Academy Award']","['ORG', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'LOC', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON']"

It was released on March 26, 2013, through Williams's label Star Trak Recordings as the lead single from Thicke's album Blurred Lines. Recorded in 2012, the drumming was inspired by the Marvin Gaye song ""Got to Give It Up"", and apart from T.I.'s rap, was entirely the work of Williams. However, Thicke claimed writing credits on the track, according to a Reuters article. The song became the subject of a bitter legal dispute with the family of Gaye and Bridgeport Music, who argued the song infringed on copyrights to the song that inspired it. Williams and Thicke were found liable for copyright infringement by a federal jury in March 2015, and Gaye was awarded posthumous songwriting credit (based on the royalties pledged to his estate).
The song's music video was released in two versions: one featuring models Emily Ratajkowski, Jessi M'Bengue, and Elle Evans topless, while the other censored the nudity. The uncensored version of the video was removed from YouTube for violating the site's terms of service, but restored with an age restriction. As of January 2020, there is no age restriction on the uncensored music video.
The lyrics and music video to ""Blurred Lines"" were controversial, with some groups claiming they are misogynistic and promote a culture of date rape. It was banned in the United Kingdom from some institutions and students' unions at universities. Thicke offered numerous rebuttals, but also called the song ""a bad joke"". Williams defended his song, saying the accusers were selectively picking apart the lyrics and the song was actually meant to empower women although Williams came to later regret working on the song. Video director Diane Martel said the music video was meant to be silly and provocative, and the women in it were meant to be overpowering the men.
""Blurred Lines"" peaked at number one in at least 25 countries and became the number one song of 2013 in several countries. It became Thicke's first, T.I.'s fourth, and Williams' third number-one single in the US, where it was also the longest running number one single for that year. It became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with sales of 14.8 million, simultaneously breaking the record for the largest radio audience in history. The single was nominated for two Grammys at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. The song has been parodied and covered numerous times.","{1378, 4741}",2,"['Marvin Gaye', 'Robin Thicke', 'Pharrell Williams', 'American', 'Robin Thicke', 'Pharrell Williams', 'Williams', 'March 26, 2013', 'Williams', 'Star Trak Recordings', 'Thicke', 'Blurred Lines', '2012', 'Marvin Gaye', 'Got to Give It Up', 'T.I.', 'Williams', 'Thicke', 'Reuters', 'Gaye and Bridgeport Music', 'Williams', 'Thicke', 'March 2015', 'Gaye', 'Emily Ratajkowski', ""Jessi M'Bengue"", 'Elle Evans', 'YouTube', 'January 2020', 'Blurred Lines', 'the United Kingdom', 'Williams', 'Williams', 'Diane Martel', 'Blurred Lines', '2013', 'Thicke', 'T.I.', 'Williams', 'US', 'that year', 'Grammys', 'Annual Grammy Awards', 'the Year', 'Best Pop Duo/Group Performance']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'LAW', 'DATE', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'EVENT', 'DATE', 'ORG']"
