			<b>What is Lorem Ipsum</b><br><br>
			Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
			industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
			scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
			electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
			Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
			Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
			<br><br><b>Why do we use it?</b><br><br>
			It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
			looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
			letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
			desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
			search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
			over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
			<br><br><b>Where does it come from?</b><br><br>
			Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
			Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
			Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
			Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
			source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
			of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
			during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
			section 1.10.32.
			The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
			1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
			original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
			<br><br><b>Where can I get some?</b><br><br>
			There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in
			some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
			going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
			middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
			necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin
			words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
			The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic
			words etc.
